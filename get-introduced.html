    <h4>Welcome to the IBM MobileFirst Platform Developer Center</h4>
    <p>This website is meant for developers of hybrid and native applications that are built with the set of tools provided by IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation, as well as MobileFirst Quality Assurance, Cloudant Data Layer Local and Application Scanning.
    <br><br>
    As a developer, you can find herein an encompassing set of “Getting Started” tutorials. By following them, you will learn how to develop, test, manage, and secure your mobile applications.</p>
    <p>If you are already using MobileFirst Platform Foundation, or if you intend to use it, for creating either hybrid or native applications, then you are in the right place.</p>

            <h4 class="no-anchor">Comprehensive Security</h4>
            <p>Protect data on the device, APIs, and your brand from hackers and vulnerabilities. You don't need to be a security expert to get started right away with building secure apps. Employ best practices by using samples and templates, and quickly make and roll out changes with a configuration-based approach.</p>

            <h4 class="no-anchor">Backend Logic Engine</h4>
            <p>Add a rich back-end logic engine to power your apps. Write your app business logic in Java or Javascript. Expose your code as REST API endpoints, and document in Swagger to promote collaboration and simplify testing.</p>

            <h4 class="no-anchor">App Lifecycle Management</h4>
            <p>Adopt a more streamlined and repeatable process for incremental app updates. For example, skip the app store approval by making changes to your app while it's live, with no recompile needed.</p>

            <h4 class="no-anchor">Push and Offline Sync</h4>
            <p>Get essential back-end services that every app needs, pre-integrated in one easy-to-use SDK.</p>

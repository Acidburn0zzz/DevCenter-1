          <h4>Welcome to the IBM MobileFirst Platform Developer Center</h4>
          <p>This website is meant for developers of hybrid and native applications that are built with the set of tools provided by IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation, as well as MobileFirst Quality Assurance, Cloudant Data Layer Local and Application Scanning.
          <br><br>
          As a developer, you can find herein an encompassing set of “Getting Started” tutorials. By following them, you will learn how to develop, test, manage, and secure your mobile applications.</p>
          <p>If you are already using MobileFirst Platform Foundation, or if you intend to use it, for creating either hybrid or native applications, then you are in the right place.</p>

          <hr>

          <h4>If you develop native applications</h4>
              You will learn how to:

              <ul>
                  <li>Integrate the MobileFirst SDK for iOS, Android, Windows Phone 8, Windows 8 and Cordova into your applications</li>
                  <li>Implement the various authentication methods provided by the MobileFirst security framework</li>
                  <li>Connect to back-end systems to retrieve information by using Java and JavaScript adapters</li>
                  <li>Use push notification</li>
                  <li>Glean data based on analytics</li>
                  <li>Operate on data by using JSONStore and Cloudant Local</li>
                  <li>Use location services</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>If you develop hybrid applications</h4>
              You will learn the same concepts as for native applications, and on top of that you will also learn how to:

              <ul>
                  <li>Enrich the application with native functionality by using Cordova plug-ins and specialized APIs</li>
                  <li>Add UI controls</li>
                  <li>Update your application remotely</li>
                  <li>Work with 3rd-party libraries</li>
                  <li>And many more advanced topics to make the best hybrid applications</li>

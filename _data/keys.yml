# Development Center (DC) keywords
# This file defines text-substitution keywords, mainly for MobileFirst Platform product terminology.
# The keywords text should not be translated.
# NOTE
# - The keywords are targeted at the current product version. Use them only in documentation for this version.
# - Do not use the keywords when the text should not change in the future. This mainly applies to release notes or migration and upgrade documentation.
#   For example, write "In V8.0.0, xxx was replaced with yyy.", and do not use the product_version keyword for the version number.
# - The "DITA" references in the file list the equivalent DITA keyword names in the V8.0.0 KC (RTC MOBILE main stream), for comparison.

# [DC-KEYS-TODO] When replacing, check also for instances with different capitalization.

####################
## Usage ##
#
## Keyword definition syntax
#       keyword: "text"
# For example, define a "product" keyword for the product name:
#       product: "MobileFirst Platform Foundation"
#
## Keyword usage syntax
#       {{ site.data.keys.keyword }}
# For example, use the "product" keyword:
#       This topic describes the {{ site.data.keys.product }} security framework.

####################
## Notes ##
# - When using a keyword in a Markdown header, the auto-generated anchor ID is derived from the header text after the keyword translation.
#   You can bypass this issue by setting a custom anchor ID for the header. However, it was decided that this is not required. (decided by Idan Adar on 29 Nov 2016).

######################################################################
## Product name ##
# [DC-KEYS-TODO] Replace source strings with these keywords only after replacing the product-component keywords, because some component strings include the product name.
# [PROD-RENAME] NOTE: Do not replace product-name instances in V6.3.0--V7.1.0 (currently the same name as in V8.0.0), or in instances that are applicable to a specific time before the upcoming Feb 2017 product renaming, because the product rebranding is not retroactive (at least not to earlier versions). You can use the v63_80rebrand_product[*] keywords for such instances.

## Product name
# [sharonl] In the KC, we have a product_wl DITA for "IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation" and a product_short keyword for "IBM MobileFirst Foundation".
# product_short is used only twice in the V8.0.0 KC. In the DC V8.0.0 docs (tutorials) there are many instances of "MobileFirst Foundation", with and without "IBM".
# I think that the "MobileFirst Foundation" terminology, was never officially approved as a standalone product shorthand (it's only used as part of some component names), and based on the DITA files as far as it was approved it was only with the "IBM" preface. -->
# [DC-KEYS-TODO] Because the product is about to be renamed shortly (using a shorter name), I think we should just replace all standalone "IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation" instances with $product_full, and replace all standalone "[IBM] MobileFirst Foundation" and "MobileFirst Platform Foundation" (no "IBM") with $product (although, to be more accurate we should ensure that he first use in each topic uses $product_full).
product:                        "MobileFirst Foundation"       # [DITA: product_short = "IBM MobileFirst Foundation"; two uses]
product_full:                   "IBM MobileFirst Foundation"   # DITA: product_wl

## Product adjective
# "MobileFirst" cannot be used on its own, as a shorthand for the product name, but it can be used as an adjective in description of product elements, such as "{{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} security framework".
# [DC-KEYS-TODO] Do this replacement last, as "MobileFirst" is used as part of most of the product name and component name keyword strings.
product_adj:                    "MobileFirst"                           # DITA: prod_adj

## "Parent" product
# [DC-KEYS] [sharonl] I selected the "parent product" terminology because the "Foundation" product is part of the "MobileFirst Platform" product. I'm assuming "MobileFirst Platform" will also be rebranded in Feb 2017. I can't be sure of any of the instances of these strings in the current DC are intended as standalone references to the "parent" product; the V8.0.0 KC has uses of the "platform" keyword (<==> $parent_product_long in YAML).
parent_product:                 "MobileFirst Platform"                  # DITA: No short version, but there's a comment that from comments it seems that "MobileFirst Platform" is allowed as a short name.
parent_product_long:            "IBM MobileFirst Platform"              # DITA: platform
parent_product_full:            "IBM MobileFirst Platform"

######################################################################
## Current product version ##
# [DC-KEYS] [sharonl] I'm not sure yet whether we need to use version keywords, and if so which keywords. We first need to remove unnecessary version references in the DC --- e.g., there are instances where it's used as part of the current product name --- and then see how many version-number instances we are left with that that don't need to be hardcoded.
# Regardless of the keyword usage, after the initial cleanup we need to decide on a specific format for referencing the product version number (not just for the current version), and use it consistently. Currently the format in the DC is inconsistent. For example, in some cases we preface the version number with 'V' or 'v', while in others we do not; in some cases we use the <V>.<R> format (e.g., "8.0.0") while in others we use <V>.<R>.<M> (e.g., "8.0.0"). The KC mostly used the "V<V>.<R>.<M> (e.g., "V8.0.0"), which was done via the Vprod keyword. I suspect that before the KC --> DC integration, the DC mostly used "<V>.<R>" (e.g., "8.0"). I also saw "v<V>x" instances in the DC (e.g., "V8.x" in https://mobilefirstplatform.ibmcloud.com/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/installation-configuration/production/appcenter/#configuring-ldap-authentication-for-websphere-application-server-v8x).
# NOTE: Avoid using the current version number in headers, or create a custom ID for the header in such cases, to avoid the inclusion of the version number in the

# Note that the KC uses the "V.R.M" variation (8.0.0 for the current version) while the DC seems to mostly use V.R (v8.0), but it has 8.0.0 instances mainly for KC-integrated text. Also, in the KC we precede the version number with 'V' (V8.0.0) while in the DC this seems to be done mainly in KC-integrated text. I also saw "v8.0" instances in the DC (e.g., "Java API elements discontinued in v8.0" in https://mobilefirstplatform.ibmcloud.com/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/product-overview/release-notes/deprecated-discontinued/#java-api-elements-discontinued-in-v80), which should be replaced either with 'V' or no prefix.
# I also saw an instance of "V8.x" (in https://mobilefirstplatform.ibmcloud.com/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/installation-configuration/production/appcenter/#configuring-ldap-authentication-for-websphere-application-server-v8x). I didn't check for other similar instances.
# --> TODO: Decide on a format and use it consistently, for all versions.

# NOTE
# - In most cases, you should not include the version number in the current-product documentation. Do not include it as part of the product name.
# - When you want to refer to a specific version and not the current version, use a hardcoded version number and not a keyword; (in such case, also avoid using the keyword for the product name of the current version). For example, "Support for xxx was removed in MobileFirst Platform Foundation V8.0.0.". This is mainly applicable to release notes and to migration and upgrade documentation.


# Version-number legend: V = Version ; R = Release ; M = Modificaiton; I = iFix

# V.R product version number
product_V_R:                "8.0"               # DITA: Vartifacts
product_V_R_stripped:       "80"
# V.R.M product version number
product_V_R_M:              "8.0.0"                                                   
product_V_R_M_stripped:     "800"
# V.R.M.I product version number
product_V_R_M_I:            "8.0.0.0"
product_V_R_M_I_stripped:   "8000"

## Product version
product_version_short:          "V8.0"
product_version:                "V8.0.0"        # DITA: Vprod
product_version_long:           "V8.0.0,0"
# [sharonl] It's also possible to use "V{{ site.data.keys.product_V_R }}" in the source file. But using keywords ensure that we reference the version using a consistent format, and allows us to easily change the format in the future (by only changing the keyword definitions).

## Product components ##

## MF Analytics

## MF Server Configuration Tool
# [DC-KEYS] [sharon[] I'm not sure whether this an MF or IBM tool, because there are no keyword versions with "MobileFirst" and/or "IBM" indications in the KC DITA files, and the existing DITA references don't add such indications "hardcoded".

# Development Center (DC) keywords
# The keywords text should not be translated.

# NOTE
# - Use the keywords on in current-version documentation (see $product_version).
# - Do not use the keywords when the text should not change in the future. This mainly applies to release notes or migration and upgrade documentation.
#   For example, write "In V8.0.0, xxx was replaced with yyy."; do not use $product_version in such cases.
# - Escape backslashes ('\') in keyword definitions with a backslash ("\\").
# - The "DITA" references in the file list the equivalent DITA keyword names in the V8.0.0 KC (RTC MOBILE main stream), for comparison.

## Usage ##
#
## Keyword definition syntax
#       keyword: "text"
# For example, define a "product" keyword for the product name:
#       product: "MobileFirst Platform Foundation"
#
## Keyword usage syntax
#       {{ site.data.keys.keyword }}
# For example, use the "product" keyword:
#       This topic describes the {{ site.data.keys.product }} security framework.

## Product name ##
# NOTE: The are some hardcoded product-name and component instances in the documentation of the current version, which are quoted from file names and product-integrated (PII) strings (such as menu options, console strings, comments, and system messages).

## Product name
product:                        "MobileFirst Foundation"       # [DITA: product_short = "IBM MobileFirst Foundation"; two uses]
product_full:                   "IBM MobileFirst Foundation"   # DITA: product_wl

## Product adjective
# "MobileFirst" cannot be used on its own, as a shorthand for the product name, but it can be used as an adjective in description of product elements, such as "{{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} security framework".
product_adj:                    "MobileFirst"                           # DITA: prod_adj

# Windows server-data directory

#prod_server_data_dir_win:       "My Documents\IBM MobileFirst Platform Server Data"
prod_server_data_dir_win:       "My Documents\\IBM MobileFirst Platform Server Data"
# Unix server-data directory

## Current product version ##
# NOTE:
# - In most cases, you should not include the version number in the current-product documentation. Do not include it as part of the product name.
# - When you want to refer to a specific version and not the current version, use a hardcoded version number and not a keyword.
#   For example, "Support for xxx was removed in MobileFirst Platform Foundation V8.0.0.".
#   This is mainly applicable to release notes and to migration and upgrade documentation.
# - Avoid using the current version number in headers, or create a custom ID for the header in such cases, to avoid the inclusion of the version number in the auto-generated anchor ID.

# [DC-KEYS-TODO] Look also for "V8.x" instances (e.g., in https://mobilefirstplatform.ibmcloud.com/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/installation-configuration/production/appcenter/#configuring-ldap-authentication-for-websphere-application-server-v8x). I didn't check for other similar instances.

# NOTE: The component keywords are defined in alphabetical order (not including the product-name prefix).

<p>IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation includes and supports various technologies to help you develop a mobile application.<br />
Each technology has its advantages and disadvantages. You must know which tool to use in any situation.<br />
The following tutorial provides an overview of these technologies.<br />
Each technology is then further covered in later tutorials.</p>
<p>MobileFirst supports both native (Objective-C, Java, etc) applications and Hybrid Web-Based applications.</p>
<h2>Full Native Development</h2>
<p>If your app requires the full power of the environment, you can develop it purely in native code.<br />
This approach is also useful when your are deploying existing native apps on the MobileFirst Server.<br />
The platform supplies a native MobileFirst Client API to manage authentication and back-end access, and to benefit from more server functionality.<br />
For more information, see various tutorials on development native applications for MobileFirst.</p>
<h2>Hybrid Web-Based Development</h2>
<p>You can choose to develop your MobileFirst application as a Hybrid, web-based application.<br />
MobileFirst Hybrid apps are developed by using standard web technologies:</p>
<ul>
<li>A single HTML file.</li>
<li>JavaScript.</li>
<li>Style sheets and images.</li>
</ul>
<p>MobileFirst apps use the MobileFirst API to access backend data and server functionality.</p>
<p>Some controls are common to most hybrid environments. Examples: modal pop-ups, loading screens and tab bars.<br />
MobileFirst provides a JavaScript API to invoke these controls regardless of the environment, and automatically renders them in a native way for each platform.<br />
For more information, see the <a title="Common UI controls" href="http://developer.ibm.com/mobilefirstplatform/documentation/getting-started-6-3/advanced-client-side-development/common-ui-controls/">Common UI Controls</a> tutorial.</p>
<h3>Environment-specific code</h3>
<p><a href="http://developer.ibm.com/mobilefirstplatform/wp-content/uploads/sites/32/2014/07/05_01_environments.png"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1281" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/05_01_environments.png" alt="05_01_environments" width="243" height="271" /></a><br />
To achieve maximum adaptation to a specific environment, web resources can be optimized specifically for it.<br />
For example, an iPhone environment requires an iPhone specific look and feel that can be achieved by extending CSS or JavaScript files.<br />
MobileFirst eases the code maintenance of multiple-environment optimization.<br />
For more information, see the <a title="Optimizing your application for various environments" href="http://developer.ibm.com/mobilefirstplatform/documentation/getting-started-6-3/2-0/optimizing-application-various-environments/">Optimizing your application for various environments</a> tutorial.<br />

<h3>Skins</h3>
<p><a href="http://developer.ibm.com/mobilefirstplatform/wp-content/uploads/sites/32/2014/07/05_01_skins.png"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1282" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/05_01_skins.png" alt="05_01_skins" width="239" height="204" /></a><br />
Skins provide support for multiple form factors in a single executable file for devices of the same OS family.<br />
Skins are a sub-variant of an environment.<br />
Skins are packaged together in one app.<br />
The decision on which skin to use is made automatically at run time.<br />
For more information, see the <a title="Supporting multiple form-factors using skins" href="http://developer.ibm.com/mobilefirstplatform/documentation/getting-started-6-3/advanced-client-side-development/supporting-multiple-form-factors-using-skins/">Supporting multiple form factors by using skins</a> tutorial.<br />
<br clear="all" /></p>
<h3>Cordova APIs</h3>
<p><a href="http://cordova.apache.org/" target="_blank">Cordova</a> is an open source development framework that is based on JavaScript for building multiplatform mobile apps.<br />
The MobileFirst Framework uses the Cordova library.  MobileFirst exposes the Cordova APIs so that developers can access native device functions through those services.<br />
For more information, see the <a title="Apache Cordova overview" href="http://developer.ibm.com/mobilefirstplatform/documentation/getting-started-6-3/adding-native-functionality/apache-cordova-overview/">Apache Cordova overview</a> tutorial.</p>
<h3>Cordova Plugins</h3>
<p>The Cordova plug-in is an abstraction that allows native components to be called by using a JavaScript API.<br />
With custom plug-ins, you can add native functions such as an encryption library or computational components and call them using JavaScript.<br />
By default, a plug-in must be implemented for each supported environment (for example, iPhone).<br />
Various Cordova plug-ins exist on the market.<br />
For more information, see the <a title="Adding native functionality to hybrid applications" href="http://developer.ibm.com/mobilefirstplatform/documentation/getting-started-6-3/adding-native-functionality/">Adding native functionality to hybrid applications</a> tutorial.</p>
<h3>Native UI</h3>
<p>MobileFirst provides different ways to augment web applications with native pages.<br />
Users can navigate freely between web and native pages, share data between pages, and share a single server session<br />
For example, contact details can be accessed by using the Apache Cordova API. However, if your application can use the contact application in the device use the Native Page API.<br />
For more information, see the <a title="Adding native functionality to hybrid applications" href="http://developer.ibm.com/mobilefirstplatform/documentation/getting-started/adding-native-functionality/">Adding native functionality to hybrid applications</a> tutorials.<br />
You can also modify the native project generated by MobileFirst to write your own custom native code. See <a title="Android – Adding native UI elements to hybrid applications" href="http://developer.ibm.com/mobilefirstplatform/documentation/getting-started-6-3/adding-native-functionality/android-adding-native-ui-elements-hybrid-applications/">Android – Adding native UI elements to hybrid applications</a> and <a title="iOS – Adding native UI elements to hybrid applications" href="http://developer.ibm.com/mobilefirstplatform/documentation/getting-started-6-3/adding-native-functionality/ios-adding-native-ui-elements-hybrid-applications/">iOS – Adding native UI elements to hybrid applications</a>.</p>
<h3>Multi-page techniques</h3>
<p>Applications with multiple pages can be built in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>A single HTML file that contains all app pages. Pages are <em>div</em>s that become hidden or shown at run time.</li>
<li>A separate HTML file for each application page.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first option is better for small apps but is less scalable.<br />
For more information, see the <a title="Building a multi-page application" href="http://developer.ibm.com/mobilefirstplatform/documentation/getting-started-6-3/2-0/building-multi-page-application/">Building a multipage application</a> tutorial.</p>
<h3>Offline Access</h3>
<p>MobileFirst apps work in concert with the MobileFirst Server.<br />
In offline mode, developers can detect app connectivity failures and determine the best course of action.<br />
Developers can define custom application behavior for offline and online status.<br />
For more information, see the <a title="Working offline" href="http://developer.ibm.com/mobilefirstplatform/documentation/getting-started-6-3/working-offline/">MobileFirst offline</a> tutorial.</p>

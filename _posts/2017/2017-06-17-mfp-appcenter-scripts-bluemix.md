Starting from MobileFirst Foundation [iFix8.0.0.0-MFPF-IF20170608-0406](https://mobilefirstplatform.ibmcloud.com/blog/2017/06/08/8-0-ifix-release/) we support the scripts for deploying IBM MobileFirst Platform Application Center for IBM Containers and Liberty for Java runtime on Bluemix.


**For Application Center on “IBM Containers” following are the high level steps**


- Setup your host computer with the required tools (Cloud Foundry CLI)
- Setup your Bluemix account
- Build a MobileFirst Application Center and push it to the Bluemix as a Cloud Foundry application
Finally, you will upload the apps on the Application Center and can install the same from devices.


**For Application Center on “Liberty for java Runtime” following are the high level steps**


- Setup your host computer with the required tools (Cloud Foundry CLI, Docker, and IBM Containers Extension (cf ic) Plug-in)
- Setup your Bluemix account
- Build a MobileFirst Application Server image and push it to the Bluemix repository.
Finally, you will run the image on IBM Containers as a single Container or a Container group, and upload the apps on the Application Center

**iOS 10.3 beta** is released. Apple has come up with a new file system called *Apple File System (APFS)* from v10.3 for iOS and watchOS, currently being developed and deployed by Apple Inc.

### What does it mean for IBM MobileFirst Platform customers and developers

All the major features such as authentication, JSONStore, app management capabilities, server connectivity and adapter invocation/chaining, notifications, Cordova plug-ins, native pages, common UI controls, and  native elements in hybrid pages all work as expected.

Advanced device security features such as App Authenticity, Device Provisioning, and others work as expected.

All the features of IBM MobileFirst Platform v7.1 and v8.0 work as expected. Existing apps when upgraded to iOS 10.3 work seamlessly.

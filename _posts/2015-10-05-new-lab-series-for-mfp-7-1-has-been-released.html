<p>This is MFP 7.1 based 1-day PoT path, that will allow you to get used to work with newest platform version within 1 day hands-on experience. During this day you will create Canteen mobile application for cashiers of canteen. They will use this app on tablets instead of having PC with touch-enabled monitors to select and report an order. This app will be using Cloudant database, MFP JS adapters, JSONStore and recently introduces cordova application project. Development will be done using Ionic Framework, MobileFirst Platform CLI and ATOM as main IDE.<br />
You will learn how to create MobileFirst Platform server instance on Bluemix. You will also learn how to use Mobile Quality Assurance service on Bluemix. Your application development will start with creating a application using ionic command-line interface. Created blank project will be then moved to a MobileFirst platform cordova application project and you will continue development from there.</p>

<p><em>Labs in this PoT are depending on each other, but you are able to skip most of them and continue afterwards by pulling source code from github, that is available separately for each lab</em></p>

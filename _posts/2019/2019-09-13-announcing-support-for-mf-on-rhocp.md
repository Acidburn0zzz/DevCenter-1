We are happy to announce the availability of IBM Mobile Foundation for [Red Hat速 OpenShift Container Platform](https://www.openshift.com/products/container-platform).   Customers can now build multi-channel applications using Mobile Foundation and leverage the capabilities on OpenShift to deliver rich, secure and scalable applications using cloud-native technologies.

OpenShift offers a consistent hybrid cloud foundation for building and scaling containerized applications and delivers a comprehensive solution for hybrid cloud, enterprise container, and Kubernetes development and deployments. It includes an enterprise-grade Linux速 operating system, container runtime, networking, monitoring, container registry, authentication, and authorization solutions. These components are tested together for unified operations on a complete Kubernetes platform spanning every cloud.

Mobile Foundation offers an industry-leading secured platform for developers to rapidly build and deploy the next generation of digital apps, including mobile, wearables, conversation, web, and PWAs. With Mobile Foundation, developers get containerized mobile back-end services covering comprehensive security, application life cycle management, push notifications, feature toggle, off-line sync, and back-end integration. The platform also ships a low-code tool for rapid application development called Digital App Builder, private app store, and rich SDKs for widely used mobile frameworks for both native and hybrid developers.

Built on IBM速 WebSphere速 offerings and OpenShift Container Platform with IBM Kabanero Enterprise, Cloud Pak for Applications provides a long-term solution to help you transition between public, private, and hybrid clouds, and create new business applications.

Customers can use the TradeUp option to move their existing licenses [ Application or Extend ] of Mobile Foundation to Virtual Processor Core licenses of Cloud Pak for Applications.  For customers who do not want to TradeUp for the move to Cloud Pak for Applications, we have ensured they can use their existing entitlement for Mobile Foundation [ Application and Addressable Device licenses ] to run the Mobile Foundation environment on OpenShift. In this case, the customer needs to bring the entitlement for OpenShift to run Mobile Foundation Applications.

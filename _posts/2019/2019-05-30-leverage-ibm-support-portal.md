[IBM Support Portal](https://www.ibm.com/support/home/) is the single destination for all your support requirements related to IBM products.
The all-new experience offered by the support portal makes it easier to lookup for APARs, PMRs, support notes, products, migration documents, and so on. You can also choose to be subscribed to receive notifications for select topics of interest for the IBM product of your choice.

With continuous delivery of fixes and enhancements to Mobile Foundation, it becomes difficult for one to stay on top of all that is current within the product. Hence we highly recommend that customers subscribe to notifications for updates delivered to Mobile Foundation, this avoids communication latency related to product updates.

Let us look at the few simple steps that describe the process of subscribing to notifications.

    >**Note**: You may get an alert saying that this product has been migrated to new support experience and that you will be redirected to this newly updated support portal. You can proceed by clicking OK.

Google has announced the next version of Android, which is [Android Q](https://developer.android.com/preview/overview). The developer preview of Android Q was launched in March 2019 and has been available for a while now for testing, development, and feedback. Android Q introduces a variety of new [features and capabilities](https://developer.android.com/preview/features.html) for end users, which gives security enhancements (such as improved biometric authentication dialogs, improved fallback support for device credentials), TLS 1.3 support, connectivity, system-wide dark mode, permissions usage, built-in screen record features and many more.

We have been testing the developer previews of Android Q Beta 2. We have verified various features of [Mobile Foundation](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/mobile-foundation) on the developer previews of Android Q for Mobile Foundation v8.0.

## Mobile Foundation Support for Android Q(Beta 2)
This post provides details about Android Q support in Mobile Foundation v8.0 and the steps that developers and IT administrators might need to take.

Here are some notable feature compatibility tests that were performed using Android Q with Mobile Foundation v8.0.

* Invoking backend procedures through adapters 
* Application Authenticity
* Application management
* JSONStore
* Direct Update 
* Oauth Flow 
* Certificate pinning
* Device SSO
* Analytics

### Existing applications
Our tests have also ensured that native Android and hybrid/Cordova apps built on older versions of Android work on the developer previews of Android Q. We have also ensured the integrity of apps on devices that upgrade from Android P to Android Q.

We encourage you to start testing your applications with the developer previews of Android Q [here](https://developer.android.com/preview/get). We would love to hear back from you.

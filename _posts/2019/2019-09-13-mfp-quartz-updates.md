Mobile Foundation runtime bundles the required libraries including a few third party libraries. Mobile Foundation uses Quartz job schedulers and includes *quartz2.2.0.jar*.

Quartz contains an *update check* feature that connects to the [server](http://www.terracotta.org/), to check if there is a new version of Quartz available for download. This check runs asynchronously and does not affect the startup/initialization time of Quartz, and it fails gracefully if the connection cannot be made. If the check runs, and an update is found, it will be reported as available in Quartzâ€™s logs.

The above update check can be disabled using the flag,
`org.quartz.scheduler.skipUpdateCheck = true`
Liberty deployment of Mobile Foundation creates a `jvm.options` file and during deployment through Server Configuration Tool, the newly created `jvm.options` file will include this property.

In the case of WebSphere Application Server (WAS) deployments, the above JNDI property needs to be added in the environment property of the Mobile Foundation application from the WAS admin console.

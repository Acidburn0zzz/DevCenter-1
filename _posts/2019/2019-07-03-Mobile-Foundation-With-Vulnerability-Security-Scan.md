In the past  MobilFirst customers reported vulnerabilities based on their application scan done through various security scanning applications such as Veracode. We at mobile Foundation validated the vulnerabilities and addressed them through iFix.
	
Below  reference table has the list of vulnerabilities reported by customers based on their application scan done through Veracode,most of them found to be false positive, while some of them already addressed through various iFix releases.

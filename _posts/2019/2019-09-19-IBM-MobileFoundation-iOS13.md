iOS 13 is [here](https://developer.apple.com/download/) and IBM Mobile Foundation is pleased to announce that we have embraced the iOS 13 upgrade gracefully like every year.

In our previous [blog post]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/2019/09/09/mfp-support-for-ios13/), we mentioned about the various new changes seen in iOS 13 and what you, as a developer should be doing about it.
Existing application(s) that were created using Mobile Foundation Platform v7.1 and v8.0 **will work** as they did on previous versions of iOS even after upgrade to iOS 13.

We have validated Mobile Foundation v8.0 and v7.1 with the GM release of iOS 13, and all the major features listed below work fine on iOS 13.

* Invoking backend procedures through adapters
* Application Authenticity
* Application management
* JSONStore
* Direct Update
* Oauth handshake with Mobile Foundation server
* Push notifications

>**Update**: Above features were tested on iPad OS and no issues were found.

Hi all!

We'd like to welcome everyone to our extended developer community on [Slack](https://slack.com/).  
This community is where developers, evaluators, customers, sales and everyone else can join together to talk about IBM MobileFirst Platform, ask questions, get help, share ideas... and well, chat.

A few disclaimers before the instructions how to join.  
Slack:

* Does not replace [opening a PMR](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21507639) for IBM support
* Does not replace [asking a question on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/new?show=all&sort=recentlyactive&tags=mobilefirst%20mobilefirst-adapters%20mobilefirst-analytics%20mobilefirst-appcenter%20mobilefirst-cli%20mobilefirst-console%20mobilefirst-installation%20mobilefirst-mtw%20mobilefirst-qa%20mobilefirst-runtime%20mobilefirst-server%20mobilefirst-studio%20or%20or%20or%20or%20or%20or%20or%20or%20or%20or%20or%20or%20or%20or%20or%20or%20or%20or%20or%20or%20or%20or%20or%20or%20or%20or%20or%20or%20worklight%20worklight-adapters%20worklight-analytics%20worklight-appcenter%20worklight-cli%20worklight-console%20worklight-deployment%20worklight-geolocation%20worklight-mbs%20worklight-mtww%20worklight-rpe%20worklight-runtime%20worklight-security%20worklight-server%20worklight-skins%20worklight-studio%20worklight-waf&mode=any)

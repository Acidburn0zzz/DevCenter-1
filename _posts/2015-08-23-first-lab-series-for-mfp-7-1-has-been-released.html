<p>This is MFP 7.1 based 1-day PoT path, that will allow you to get used to work with newest platform version within 1 day. During this day you will create Comrade mobile application. This app will be using Adapter-based authentication, MFP HTTP Adapter and recently introduces cordova application project. Development will be done using Ionic Framework, MobileFirst Platform CLI and ATOM as main IDE. You will also learn how to use Mobile Quality Assurance service on Bluemix. Your application development will start with UI preparation using Ionic Creator drag’n’drop tool. Created UI project will be then moved to a MobileFirst platform cordova application project and you will continue development from there.</p>

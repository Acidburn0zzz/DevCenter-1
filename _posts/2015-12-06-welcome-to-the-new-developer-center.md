Hello everyone!

As you may have noticed, we've made some changes to the Developer Center website.  
Here's a quick list of what you can expect:

* New responsive design
* Tutorials are readable on mobile devices
* Improved discovery of tutorials with new top-level and side-bar menus
* Improved [blog]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/) experience
* All-new [Labs]({{site.baseurl}}/labs/)
* All-new [video gallery]({{site.baseurl}}/video-gallery/)
* Open sourced on [GitHub.com](https://www.github.com/mobilefirst-platform-developer-center/devcenter) - feel free to fork and send us pull requests!
* Hosted and powered by [IBM Bluemix](https://bluemix.net)

The new website was made possible thanks to technologies such as: [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), [Bootstrap](getbootstrap.com), [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) and lots more.  
We hope you will enjoy all the new things we've put into the site, and welcome comments below.

If you have been following the mobile developers' chatter on the internet, you are probably already aware that new apps submitted to the [Google Play Store requires apps to target API level 26 (Android Oreo) or higher](https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/develop/target-sdk), since August 1, 2018. Existing apps on the Play Store will have to target their apps to API 26 (Android Oreo) or higher before publishing any updates starting November 1, 2018. Ensure that you factor in this requirement before you publish apps to the Google Play Store starting November 1, 2018. 

In accordance with the [support plan for IBM MobileFirst](https://mobilefirstplatform.ibmcloud.com/blog/2017/01/11/support-plan-for-next-android-ios-mobile-os/), all existing apps built on MobileFirst v7.1 and v8.0 will be compliant with this new requirement. This support does not extend to MobileFirst v7.0 and earlier releases. 

>**Note:** *An issue exists with Push Notifications when hybrid apps built on MobileFirst v7.1 are targeted to API Level 26 or above. An iFix for this issue will be soon rolled out.*

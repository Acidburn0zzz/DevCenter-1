If you have been following the mobile developers' chatter on the Internet, you're probably already aware that new apps submitted to the [Google Play Store requires apps to target API level 26 (Android Oreo) or higher](https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/develop/target-sdk) since August 1, 2018. Existing apps on the Play Store will have to target their apps to API 26 (Android Oreo) or higher before publishing any updates starting November 1, 2018. Ensure that you factor this in while publishing any apps to the Google Play Store starting November 1, 2018. 

In accordance with the [support plan for IBM MobileFirst](https://mobilefirstplatform.ibmcloud.com/blog/2017/01/11/support-plan-for-next-android-ios-mobile-os/), all existing apps built on MobileFirst v7.1 and v8.0 will be compliant with this new requirement. This does not extend to releases of MobileFirst v7.0 and earlier releases. 

*Note: There is an issue with Push Notifications when hybrid apps built on MobileFirst v7.1 are targeted to API Level 26 or above which has already been identified and an iFix will be rolled out shortly for the same at the earliest. *

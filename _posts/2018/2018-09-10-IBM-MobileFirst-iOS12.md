iOS12 is [here](https://developer.apple.com/download/) and IBM MobileFirst is pleased to announce we have embraced the iOS12 upgrade gracefully like every year.

In our previous [blog post]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/2018/07/23/mfp-support-for-ios12/), we mentioned about the various new changes seen in iOS12 and what you, as a developer should be doing about it.
Existing application(s) that were created using MobileFirst Platform v7.1 and v8.0 **will work** as they did on previous versions of iOS even after upgrade to iOS12.

With the final release of iOS12, we have validated MobileFirst v8.0 and v7.1 and the all the major features listed below work fine with iOS12.

* Invoking backend procedures through adapters
* Application Authenticity
* Application management
* JSONStore
* Direct Update
* Oauth handshake with Mobile First server
* Push notifications

### Targeting to build your app with iOS12  

* If you are planning to build your MobileFirst v8 application for iOS12 you have to get rid of **stdc++** library which is removed in iSO12. Refer our previous [blog post]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/2018/07/23/mfp-support-for-ios12/) for details of the workaround.
If you dont want to go for workaround and looking for a permanent solution upgrade to MobileFirst iFix [mfp-ifix-IF201809041150]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/2018/05/18/8-0-master-ifix-release/#collapse-mfp-ifix-IF201809041150) for v8.0.

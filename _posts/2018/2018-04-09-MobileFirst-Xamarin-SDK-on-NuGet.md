The [Xamarin Component Store](http://components.xamarin.com/) has been the home of several libraries and components published for Xamarin projects. The [MobileFirst SDK for Xamarin](https://components.xamarin.com/view/ibm-worklight) has been made available through the Xamarin Component Store ever since it was launched in 2014. 

However, in November last year, Microsoft [announced plans to sunset the Xamarin Component Store](https://blog.xamarin.com/hello-nuget-new-home-xamarin-components/) in favour of all components and libraries being made available on NuGet. 

As a direct result of this announcement, the MobileFirst SDK for Xamarin will also be moved to NuGet. All future versions of the Xamarin SDK will be published on NuGet and no further updates to the Xamarin SDK will be made available through Xamarin Component Store. The existing versions of the MobileFirst SDK for Xamarin that are already published on the Xamarin Component Store will continue to be available. 

The MobileFirst SDK for Windows platform has been available from NuGet for a while now. The same package will now contain the libraries necessary for Xamarin.Android and Xamarin.iOS projects. 
Therefore, irrespective of whether you are developing MobileFirst apps for Xamarin.Android, Xamarin.iOS or Windows, you can get all the libraries directly from [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/IBM.MobileFirstPlatformFoundation/). 

To reiterate, add the NuGet package for MobileFirst whether you are developing for Xamarin.Android, Xamarin.iOS or Windows.

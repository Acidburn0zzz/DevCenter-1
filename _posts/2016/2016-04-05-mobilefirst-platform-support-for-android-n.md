![Android N](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/97674776/android-n.jpg)
Google took pretty much everyone by surprise when it debuted a developer preview of [Android N](http://developer.android.com/preview/index.html), over two months before the expected announcement at Google I/O. To run and test your app on the new platform you need to set up an [Android N runtime environment](http://developer.android.com/preview/download.html).

The developer preview version provides a flavour of the new [features](http://developer.android.com/preview/api-overview.html) like Multi-window support, Notification enhancements, Doze on the go, Data Saver.

MobileFirst platform plays well with Android N, we tested a bunch of feature like AdapterBasedAuth, CustomAuth, EventSourceNotifications, FormBasedAuth, InvokingAdapterProcedures, TagNotifications, PushNotifications. We have not seen any issue with any of these. We have performed a sanity check to ensure that all the existing apps built on Android Marshmallow work on Android N platform.

Stay tuned for more updates.

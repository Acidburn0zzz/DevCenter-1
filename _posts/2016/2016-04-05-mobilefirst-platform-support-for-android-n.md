![Android N](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/97674776/android-n.jpg)
Google took pretty much everyone by surprise when it debuted a developer preview of [Android N](http://developer.android.com/preview/index.html), over two months before the expected announcement at Google I/O. To run and test your app on the new platform you need to set up an [Android N runtime environment](http://developer.android.com/preview/download.html).

The developer preview version provides a flavour of the new [features](http://developer.android.com/preview/api-overview.html) like Multi-window support, Notification enhancements, Doze on the go, Data Saver.

MobileFirst Platform Foundation V7.1 plays well with Android N, we tested a bunch of feature like adapter based authentication, custom authentication, event source notifications, form based authentication, invoking adapter procedures, tag notifications, push notifications. We have not seen any issue with any of these. We have performed a sanity check to ensure that all the existing apps built on Android Marshmallow work on Android N platform.

Stay tuned for more updates.

Hi all!  
We'd like to let you all know of recent changes we've made to the Developer Center.

The biggest change is that all product documentation for MobileFirst Foundation 8.0 is now [right here in the Developer Center]({{site.baseurl}}/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/all-tutorials) (sans API reference, but it's coming. Promise).

No more switching between the IBM Knowlege Center and Developer Center - you now have a single source for all documenation, tutorials, labs, blogs and videos.  
We hope you will enjoy the website's cleaner and friendlier content presentation, navigation and responsiveness. Use the search field at the top of the website to search.

Let us know in the comments section below if you have any questions, comments, or feedback.

Additionaly, we've recently added the following:

* The Live Update feature now sports [an SDK for Cordova applications]({site.baseurl}/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/application-development/live-update/) as well.
* [Integration with IBM API Connect]({site.baseurl}/tutorials/en/product-integration/8.0/api-connect/) is now documented.
* Google recently rebranded GCM push notifications as FCM as part of the Firebase acquisition. Some FCM setup instructions were changed as well [and so did our documentation]({{site.baseurl}}/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/notifications/sending-notifications/#google-cloud-messaging-firebase-cloud-messaging).
* Our repertoire of advanced samples has grown so we [now have a dedicated page]({{site.baseurl}}/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/advanced-samples/) listing them.

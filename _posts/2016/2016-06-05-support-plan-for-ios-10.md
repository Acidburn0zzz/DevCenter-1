iOS 10 may be announced in Apple's upcoming [World Wide Developer Conference](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/) next week (June 13th - 17th).  
**Update:** [announced](https://developer.apple.com/ios/)!

IBM plans to provide service updates to IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation to support the new iOS release based on the terms described in [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27045489](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27045489). Note that this policy is not dictated by the Program Technical Support's lifecycle as stated in the product's version announce letter because a new version of a supported mobile operating system is considered a new feature. In other words, we do not plan to introduce support for iOS 10 in IBM Worklight Foundation 6.2 or earlier releases.

For those customers who have iOS apps developed using IBM Worklight Foundation 6.2 or earlier releases, and intend to have their app running on iOS 10, an upgrade to a later release is required. Talk to your IBM representative about how we can help.

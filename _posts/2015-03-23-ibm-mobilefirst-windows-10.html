<blockquote><p> Windows 10 is officially out and users have started receiving <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2015/07/28/your-free-upgrade-is-here-windows-10-launches-with-worldwide-celebrations-with-fans-upgradeyourworld-and-more/">OTA upgrades!</a> Read about MobileFirst on the official Windows 10 release <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/mobilefirstplatform/2015/07/29/mobilefirst-is-ready-for-windows-10/">here</a> </p></blockquote>
<p>Microsoft announced the Technical Preview for Windows 10 desktop and tablets and Phones. We, at IBM Software Labs have laid our hands on the preview builds of both the desktop and phone versions of Windows 10 and quickly got MobileFirst applications deployed and running on these two platforms. You too can get hold of the preview builds by registering for the <a href="https://insider.windows.com/">Windows Insider program</a>. Once you have enrolled to the Windows Insider program, you can upgrade to Windows 10 by running the <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview-download">Windows Technical Preview installer </a> .</p>
<p>For the Windows Phone, only a small subset of Lumia devices can be moved to Windows 10. See the list of devices <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview-supported-phones">here</a> .<br />
To install the Windows 10 Technical preview on the phone, you'll have to download the <a href="https://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/windows-insider/ed2b1421-6414-4544-bd8d-06d58ee402a5">Windows Insider</a> app and sign in with your Microsoft ID.</p>
<p>We upgraded a Lenovo X220 laptop to Windows 10 and a Lumia 630 phone was moved to Windows 10 for Phones. Our initial impression of running both hybrid and native apps developed on the MobileFirst platform on Windows 10 and Windows Phone 10 seems good.<br />
Applications can connect to the MobileFirst server and invoke backend procedures. Other useful functionalities such as Direct Update, application management and push notifications also play well with Windows 10 and Windows 10 for Phones.</p>
<p>Windows 10 changes how MobileFirst application management notifications appear. While on Windows 8 and 8.1, the notifications take up the full horizontal width of the screen, Windows 10 shows a smaller dialog box.</p>

<p>Keep an eye on this page for further updates as we continue validating more IBM MobileFirst features on Windows 10 and Windows 10 for Phones</p>

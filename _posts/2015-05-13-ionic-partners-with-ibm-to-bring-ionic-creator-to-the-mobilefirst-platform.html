<p>One of our goals for Ionic Creator was to help developers and business users quickly prototype hybrid mobile apps. Now, business users without software development skills can prototype apps in minutes that are ready for enterprise integration, using Ionic Creator and the IBM MobileFirst Platform. Organizations will now have a mobile app development and enterprise integration solution that includes analytics, management, and security options. We expect this exciting new partnership to increase the number of mobile apps being built in the enterprise environment and expand the available work opportunities for experienced Ionic developers.<br />
<br clear="all" />Business analysts and managers in finance, HR, and marketing will be able to use Ionic Creator to come up with app ideas and then collaborate with developers to build the infrastructure for their prototype. They’ll be able to use the IBM MobileFirst Platform to deploy the app.<br />
<br clear="all" />The IBM MobileFirst Platform helps business users build and deploy mobile apps or integrate apps built with third party tools, like Ionic. Data can be integrated from enterprise systems in a contextual, personalized, secure way.<br clear="all" /><br />
By expanding our collaborations with business teams and making Ionic useful to enterprise users, we’ll be able to expand our audience and provide more developers with a way to create hybrid mobile apps. We’re really looking forward to this next step and welcome these new teams of users to the Ionic community.

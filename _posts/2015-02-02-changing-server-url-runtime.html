<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>An often requested feature by customers for MobileFirst Platform (previously Worklight) is having the ability to change, during runtime, the MobileFirst Server URL an application will attempt connecting to.</p>
<p>What can you do with it, you ask? Well, an example scenario would be a single client application for multiple sites/locations or customers. It could be likened to the MobileFirst Application Center Installer app, where you are not required to re-build the application for every server, rather you simply set a different IP address via the app's UI in order to connect to a different Application Center server to be served whichever applications that were deployed to it.</p>
<p>Now, starting MobileFirst Platform v6.3, this is also possible for Hybrid (iOS, Android) and Native (iOS, Android, WP8) applications attempting to connect to a MobileFirst Server during runtime and without the need to re-build the application.</p>
<p>In this blog post I will provide a quick usage example for the Hybrid API methods, for getting and setting the server URL in a simple demo application.</p>
<h3>Note on feature availability</h3>
<p>This feature can be used only in emulators/simulators and physical devices.<br />
It is <em>not</em> supported while previewing the application's web resources in the MobileFirst Console.</p>
<h2>Download and documentation</h2>
<p>You can download the demo application <a href="https://github.com/IdanAdar/Change-Server-URL">from my GitHub repository</a>.<br />
For API documentation visit this <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSHS8R_6.3.0/com.ibm.worklight.getstart.doc/what_s_new/c_wn_api.html">IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation user documentation page</a>.</p>
<h2>Demo application</h2>
<p>So what's going on in the application?</p>
<p>As written above, this is a pretty simple application. It allows you to get &amp; set the server URL as well as provide a verification that the URL change was successful. After the image is a quick rundown of the application's flow.</p>

<h3>Application flow</h3>
<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p><code>WL.Client.connect</code> is called in order to connect to a MobileFirst Server. This can be either the MobileFirst Development Server in Eclipse, or a remote MobileFirst Server.</p>
<p>One pre-requisite is to make sure the .wlapp file of the application is deployed at each server that you intend to be able to connect to from the application.</p>
<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>To find out what is the URL of the current server the application is intended to connect to, <code>WL.App.getServerUrl</code> is used:</p>
<p>[code lang="js"]function getServerURL() {<br />
    WL.App.getServerUrl(getServerURLSuccess, getServerURLFailure)<br />
}</p>
<p>function getServerURLSuccess(serverURL) {<br />
    WL.SimpleDialog.show(<br />
	&quot;Change Server URL&quot;, &quot;Server URL is: &quot; + JSON.stringify(serverURL),<br />
	[{<br />
	    text: &quot;Close&quot;, handler: function() {}<br />
	}]<br />
    )<br />
}<br />
...<br />
...[/code]</p>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>The application successfully connected to a MobileFirst server using the current server URL. To change the server URL to another server's URL, <code>WL.App.setServerUrl</code> is used. In this sample I chose to have the end-user manually enter a fully qualified address by inputting the <code>protocol</code>, <code>host/IP address</code>, <code>port</code> and <code>context root</code>, but of course this is purely applicative.</p>
<p>Possible alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li>A UI with a dropdown or otherwise, pre-filled with pre-defined server URLs</li>
<li>Entering only the context root or only the host/IP address (and handling in the app logic any string operations)</li>
<li>You name it</li>
</ul>
<p>[code lang="js"]function setServerURL() {<br />
    // Get the URL from the text field.<br />
    var serverURL = $(&quot;#serverURL&quot;).val();<br />
    WL.App.setServerUrl(serverURL, setServerURLSuccess, setServerURLFailure);<br />
}</p>
<p>function setServerURLSuccess() {<br />
    // Display the newly set server URL.<br />
    getServerURL();<br />
}<br />
...<br />
...[/code]</p>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>After setting the new server URL, we can now tap the connect button to connect again. Viola!</p>

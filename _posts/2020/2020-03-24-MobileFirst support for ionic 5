We are happy to announce that IBM Mobile Foundation v8.0 officially supports the latest Ionic 5. 

The below Mobile Foundation v8.0 features have been validated with the stable release of Ionic 5 and cordova-plugin-mfp version 8.0.2020030204 :

* Invoking back-end procedures through adapters
* Application management
* JSONStore
* Oauth handshake with Mobile Foundation server
* Push notifications

<b>Direct Update</b></br>
We have observed some intermittent loading issues with respect to direct update. It is mandatory to add the worklight.d.ts reference in the module.ts files rather than in component.ts files to avoid the possible loading errors.

The below reference addition has to be done in module.ts files (not in component.ts files) : 
`///<reference path="../../plugins/cordova-plugin-mfp/typings/worklight.d.ts"/>`


<b>Application Authenticity</b></br>
Dynamic App Authenticity is fully functional in both Android and iOS. We have observed issues with BTS. We are actively working on resolving them.

</br>
The runs have been performed on an app with the following dependency packages and corresponding versions :

   Ionic CLI                     : 5.4.15
   
   Ionic Framework               : 5.0.5(@ionic/angular)

  cordova-android 					: 8.1.0
  
  cordova-ios 						: 5.1.1

>>NOTE: MF v8.0 does not support @ionic/react and @ionic/vue yet.

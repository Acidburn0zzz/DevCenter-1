## Overview
{: #overview }
React Native is a framework for building native iOS and Android application using [React](https://reactjs.org/) that helps you rapidly build native mobile applications using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

If you are a developer who has chosen React Native as the framework to develop your mobile or web app, the following sections help you get started with [IBM Mobile Foundation](http://mobilefirstplatform.ibmcloud.com) SDK in  your React Native app.

You can use your preferred code editor such as Atom.io, Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, IntelliJ and others for writing your applications.

**Prerequisite:** As you setup your React Native development environment, make sure to also read the [Setting up the MobileFirst development environment](https://mobilefirstplatform.ibmcloud.com/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/installation-configuration/development/mobilefirst) tutorial.

## Installing the React Native CLI
{: #installing_cli }
To get started with React Native development the first step required is to install the [React Native CLI](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html).

**To install React Native CLI:**

* Download and install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/).
* From a Command-line window, run the command:
```bash
npm install -g react-native-cli
```

## Adding the Mobile Foundation SDK to your React Native app
{: #adding_mfp_reactnative_sdk }
To continue with MobileFirst development in React Native applications, the MobileFirst React Native SDK or plug-ins need to be added to the React Native application.

Learn how to add the MobileFirst SDK to React Native applications.
For application development, refer to the tutorial [Adding the Mobile Foundation SDK to React Native applications]({{site.baseurl}}/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/application-development/sdk/reactnative).

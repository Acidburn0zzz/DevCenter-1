## What is Cloudant?
Cloudant is a NoSQL Database as a Service (DBaaS) that is based on CouchDB and  available from [cloudant.com](http://cloudant.com).

### What is Cloudant Data Layer Local Edition?
IBM® MobileFirst Platform Cloudant® Data Layer Local Edition is a database management system (DBSM) designed from the ground up to support today's scaling demands. IBM MobileFirst Platform Cloudant Local is a great complement to Cloudant's cloud-based service. It can be run either in concert with the cloud — to support load spikes — or just within your data centers — to support privacy.

IBM MobileFirst Platform Cloudant Local includes all the key features of Cloudant's SaaS offering: robust data synchronization with mobile devices, analytics views, text search and advanced geo-spatial capabilities, all wrapped up in an intuitive dashboard. But you run it within your own controlled environment.

IBM MobileFirst Platform Cloudant Local can be licensed month-by-month or on a perpetual basis, and includes a full suite of tools to help you set up and monitor your database deployment.

Cloudant forms the ideal data backend for your mobile applications:

- Elastic Scalability – Lets you scale data with demand, with the ability to span multiple data centers or cloud providers.
- Data Synchronicity – Host data globally to reduce latency and eliminate single points of failure.
- Geo-Mobility – Manage data locally on a device, and make use of advanced geospatial capabilities to simplify development of location-based apps.

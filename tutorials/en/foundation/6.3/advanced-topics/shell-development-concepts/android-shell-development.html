<p>This module is a continuation of the tutorial <a href="../">Shell Development Concepts</a>.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In this module, you learn how to add an Android environment to your shell component, test application, and inner application.</p>
<h2>Adding an Android environment to a shell component</h2>
<p>Start by adding a new Android environment to your shell component by following the same procedure as for a standard MobileFirst application.<br />
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/backup/10_02_new-environment.png"/></p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/backup/10_02_env-structure.png"/><br />
The following folder structure is created:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>css, images, fragments</strong> and <strong>js</strong> contain resources that override or extend resources from the shell component common folder.
</li>
<li>The <strong>native</strong> folder contains an application template to be used when you create an Android project from an inner application.
</li>
<li>The <strong>nativeEmptyApp</strong> folder contains application that is built from the shell component and an empty inner application as described in the <a href="http://developer.ibm.com/mobilefirstplatform/documentation/getting-started-6-3/advanced-topics/shell-development-concepts/" title="Shell development concepts">Shell Development Concepts</a> tutorial.
</li>
</ul>
<p><br clear="all" /></p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/backup/10_02_native_structure.png"/><br />
The files in the <strong>native</strong> folder are templates that are used to create the inner application Android project.<br />
Some of the folder and file names contain placeholder elements that are populated during build.<br />
For example</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>${packageDirectory}</strong> placeholder is populated with a package name used in the application.
</li>
<li>The <strong>${appName}</strong> placeholder is populated with the application name, thus creating the main application activity.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Files with the <strong>.wluser</strong> extensions are template files that shell developers can modify.<br />
<br clear="all" /></p>
<h2>Adding custom Java code to a shell component</h2>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/backup/10_02_native_structure2.png"/><br />
Because the <em>android\native</em> folder of a shell component is not an Android project, Eclipse does not provide advanced features such as auto-complete when you work on it directly.<br />
The solution is to use the Android environment to create, modify, and debug Java code.<br />
The generated Android project is added to your workspace.<br />
Use it to work with your Java code.<br />
<br clear="all" /></p>
<p>Add the <strong>com.mycustomcode</strong> package to the generated Android project.<br />
Add <strong>MyCustomToaster.java</strong> class under this package.<br />
Add a static method to this class:<br />
{% highlight java %}<br />
public class MyCustomToaster {<br />
  public static void showToastAlert(Activity context, String text) {<br />
    Toast.makeText(context, text, 2000).show();<br />
  }<br />
}<br />
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>Open your main application activity.<br />
Start <em>MyCustomToast.showToastAlert()</em>:<br />
{% highlight java %}<br />
public class MyShellTest extends WLDroidGap {<br />
  @Override<br />
  public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState){<br />
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);<br />
    //DeviceAuthManager.getInstance().setProvisioningDelegate(<replace with...>)<br />
    super.loadUrl(getWebMainFilePath());<br />
    MyCustomToaster.showToastAlert(this, "Hello from Android Shell");<br />
  }<br />
}<br />
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>Run your application to see the implemented functions.<br />
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/backup/10_02_java_results.png"/></p>
<p>Finally, copy your Java code from the Android project that you used to develop it back to the shell component.</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/backup/10_02_java_copy.png"/><br />
The custom Java classes that were added to the Android project can be copied to keep the package structure intact.<br />
Modifications that are made to the predefined files created by MobileFirst Studio, however, must be copied manually to the corresponding template files. In this specific case, a highlighted line from the <strong>MyShellTest.java</strong> must be copied to <strong>${appName}.java.wltemplate.wluser</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>native</strong> folder of the test application is not being rebuilt from the shell component each time you build the Android application.<br />
Doing so avoids overwriting the test application native code with the one in the shell component on each build, thus allowing shell developers to debug their code conveniently.<br />
If you want your native folder to be fully re-created from a shell component, erase it in the test application, and then build and deploy the application.</p>
<h2>Using the NativeEmptyApp Project</h2>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/backup/10_02_NativeEmptyApp-project.png"/><br />
<strong>NativeEmptyApp</strong> is a native application project that uses the Shell component, and that has an empty inner application.<br />
This project can be built as an APK or IPA by a shell developer, and sent to inner application developers to use for debugging their applications.<br />
After the NativeEmptyApp is installed on the device, an inner application developer can specify the URL of the MobileFirst Server from which to load the inner application.<br />
Doing so helps inner application developers to test their code without the need to have native SDKs installed.<br />
For example: to develop and test iPhone application without a Mac.<br />
To use NativeEmptyApp, import its folder as a generic project in Eclipse.</p>
<p>The native empty application is automatically recognized as an Android project.<br />
When the application is built and deployed to an Android device, click Menu and go to Settings to change the URL from which this inner application content is loaded.<br />

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/backup/10_02_nativeempty_app.png"/></p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong><br />
NativeEmptyApp cannot load a remote inner application that has the device provisioning enabled.<br />
NativeEmptyApp can be used only in the development environment.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In this tutorial a general development information for the BlackBerry 6/7 environment will be presented.</p>
<h2>Project structure</h2>
<p>A BlackBerry application that is developed with IBM MobileFirst Platform is composed of the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li>A set of JavaScript libraries that provide access to various device features and capabilities</li>
<li>Web application code that is provided by the developer, that is written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and that runs in one or more instances of the browser</li>
<li>All the application components, including the web code that the developer provides, packaged into a single BlackBerry project</li>
</ul>
<p>IBM MobileFirst Platform supports BlackBerry devices that run BlackBerry OS version 6, 7.x and 10.x.<br />
If using a source control management system (such as Rational Team Concertâ„¢, Git, Subversion and so on), see the user documentation topic: "Integrating with source control system".</p>
<h2>Publishing</h2>
<p>BlackBerry applications are published through BlackBerry App World.</p>

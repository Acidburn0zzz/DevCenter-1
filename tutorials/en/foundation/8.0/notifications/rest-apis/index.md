## REST APIs
You can use REST Services APIs to work with notifications.

* Use [REST API Administration services](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSHS8R_8.0.0/com.ibm.worklight.apiref.doc/apiref/c_restapi_oview.html) for adapters and applications.
* Use [REST API for the MobileFirst Server push service](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSHS8R_8.0.0/com.ibm.worklight.apiref.doc/rest_runtime/c_restapi_runtime.html#restruntime) to access Push functions from a REST API endpoint.

## Swagger
In the development environment provided by the [DevKit Installer](../../setting-up-your-development-environment/mobilefirst-development-environment) you can also access the Push REST APIs from a Swagger UI. To access it, load the following URL: [http://localhost:9080/doc/?url=/imfpush/v1/swagger.json](http://localhost:9080/doc/?url=/imfpush/v1/swagger.json).

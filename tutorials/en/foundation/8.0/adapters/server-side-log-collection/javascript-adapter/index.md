## Server Setup
To set-up logging in JavaScript adapters:

1. In MobileFirst Operations Console select the **Settings** option from the sidebar navigation.

## Logging example
The message below outputs to the `trace.log` file of the application server. If the server administrator is forwarding logs from the MobileFirst Server to the MobileFirst Analytics server the `logger` message will also appear in the Server Log Search view in the MobileFirst Analytics Console.

```javascript
MFP.Logger.debug("This is a debug message from a JavaScript adapter");
```

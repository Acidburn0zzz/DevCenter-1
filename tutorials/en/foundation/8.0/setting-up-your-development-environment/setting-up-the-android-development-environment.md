### Android SDK
The Android SDK provides the tools and APIs required to develop applications on the Android platform, using the Java programming language.

Once you open Android Studio for the time, you will be able to configure the Android SDK using the SDK Manager.

In the SDK Manager you can install required packages. For more information, [visit the Android Developer website](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html).

#### Android Virtual Devices
You can use an AVD to test your application. For a detailed explanation of all available options, see the [Managing Virtual Devices documentation topic](http://developer.android.com/tools/devices/index.html) in the Android Developers website.

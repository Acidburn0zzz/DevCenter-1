## Overview
Cordova application development allows developers to use their preferred tools and code editors.  
To get started with [Cordova development](https://cordova.apache.org/) the very basic required step is to install the Cordova CLI. To continue with MobileFirst development in Cordova applications, the MobileFirst SDK plug-ins need to be added to the Cordova application.

**Prerequisite:** As you setup your Cordova development environment, make sure to also read the [Setting up the MobileFirst development environment](../../setting-up-your-development-environment/mobilefirst-development-environment/) tutorial.

## Installing the Cordova CLI
MobileFirst Platform Foundation supports Apache [Cordova CLI 6.0.0](https://cordova.apache.org/news/2016/01/28/tools-release.html).  
To install:

1. Download and install [NodeJS v4.3 LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/).
2. From a **Command-line** window, run the command: `npm install -g cordova`.

## Next steps
You can use your preferred code editor, such as Atom.io, Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, IntelliJ and others, to implement applications and adapters.  

* Learn how to add the [MobileFirst SDK to Cordova applications](../../adding-the-mfpf-sdk/cordova/).
* For applications development, refer to the [Using the MobileFirst Platform Foundation SDK](../../using-the-mfpf-sdk/) tutorials.
* For adapters develpment, refer to the [Adapters](../../adapters/) category as well as to the [Developing Adapters in IDEs](../../adapters/developing-adapters) and [testing and debugging adapters](../../adapters/testing-and-debugging-adapters/) tutorials.

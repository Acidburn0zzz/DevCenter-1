## Overview
IBM MobileFirst Foundation's **JSONStore** is an optional client-side API providing a lightweight, document-oriented storage system. JSONStore enables persistent storage of **JSON documents**. Documents in an application are available in JSONStore even when the device that is running the application is offline. This persistent, always-available storage can be useful to give users access to documents when, for example, there is no network connection available in the device.

#### Key features

* Data indexing for efficient searching
* Data encryption in production environments
* Mechanism for tracking local-only changes to the stored data
* Support for multiple users

> **Note:** Some features such as data encryption are beyond the scope of this tutorial. All features are documented in detail in the IBM MobileFirst Foundation user documentation website.

This tutorial provides additional information for native applications that are developed with IBM MobileFirst Foundation.

## iOS application development

### Adding the MobileFirst iOS SDK
To develop a native iOS application, you must add the MobileFirst framework files to your Xcode project and register the app on the IBM MobileFirst Platform Server. You can add the MobileFirst frameworks to your Xcode project either manually or using CocoaPods.

> Learn more on [adding the MobileFirst SDK](../../adding-the-mfpf-sdk/ios) and registering iOS applications

### Adding optional MobileFirst iOS frameworks
MobileFirst iOS functionality is provided by a collection of frameworks that can be added to your app. Only one of these frameworks is required (IBMMobileFirstPlatformFoundation). You can add optional frameworks according to the features you want to implement in your app. You reduce the size of the app by including only the frameworks required by your chosen features.

For an existing MobileFirst Xcode project, you can add frameworks manually by linking the frameworks in Xcode or by using Cocoapods.

| Feature                                            | Frameworks (linked in the Link Binary with Libraries list in the Build Phases tab) | 
|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| JSONStore                                          | **IBMMobileFirstPlatformFoundationJSONStore**, **SQLCipher**. In addition, import the **IBMMobileFirstPlatformFoundationJSONStore** header to your code. For more information on setup, see the [JSONStore tutorial](../jsonstore/ios). |
| OpenSSL                                            | **openssl**, **IBMMobileFirstPlatformFoundationOpenSSLUtils**. For more information on OpenSSL, see [Enabling OpenSSL for iOS](enabling-openssl-in-ios) |
| Push                                               | **IBMMobileFirstPlatformFoundationPush**. In addition, import the **IBMMobileFirstPlatformFoundationPush** header to your code. For more information, see the [Notifications tutorials](../../notifications). |
| watchOS                                            | **IBMMobileFirstPlatformFoundationWatchOS**. The watchOS framework requires a different structure for the Xcode project. For information on adding the watchOS framework, see [Adding watchOS frameworks](watchos). |

### Working with bitcode in iOS apps

* The application-authenticity security check is not supported with bitcode.
* watchOS applications require bitcode enabled.

To enable bitcode, in your Xcode project navigate to the **Build Settings** tab and set **Enable Bitcode** to **Yes**.

### Enforcing TLS-secure connections in iOS apps
Starting from iOS 9, Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol version 1.2 must be enforced in all apps. You can disable this protocol and bypass the iOS 9 requirement for development purposes.

Apple App Transport Security (ATS) is a new feature of iOS 9 that enforces best practices for connections between the app and the server. By default, this feature enforces some connection requirements that improve security. These include client-side HTTPS requests and server-side certificates and connection ciphers that conform to Transport Layer Security (TLS) version 1.2 using forward secrecy.

For d**evelopment purposes**, you can override the default behavior by specifying an exception in the info.plist file in your app, as described in App Transport Security Technote. However, in a **full production** environment, all iOS apps must enforce TLS-secure connections for them to work properly.

To enable non-TLS connections, the following exception must appear in the **project-name-info.plist** file in the **project-name\Resources** folder:

```xml
<key>NSExceptionDomains</key>
    <dict>
        <key>yourserver.com</key>
    
            <dict>
            <!--Include to allow subdomains-->
            <key>NSIncludesSubdomains</key>
            <true/>

            <!--Include to allow insecure HTTP requests-->
            <key>NSTemporaryExceptionAllowsInsecureHTTPLoads</key>
            <true/>
        </dict>
    </dict>
```

To prepare for production

1. Remove, or comment out the code that appears earlier in this page.  
2. Set up the client to send HTTPS requests by using the following entry to the dictionary:  

    ```xml
    <key>protocol</key>
    <string>https</string>

    <key>port</key>
    <string>10443</string>
    ```
    The SSL port number is defined on the server in **server.xml** in the `httpEndpoint` definition.
    
3. Configure a server that is enabled for the TLS 1.2 protocol. For more information, [see Configuring MobileFirst Server to enable TLS V1.2](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21965659)
4. Make settings for ciphers and certificates, as they apply to your setup. For more information, see [App Transport Security Technote](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/technotes/App-Transport-Security-Technote/), [Secure communications using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) for WebSphereÂ® Application Server Network Deployment](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/ae/csec_sslsecurecom.html?cp=SSAW57_8.5.5%2F1-8-2-33-4-0&lang=en), and [Enabling SSL communication for the Liberty profile](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.nd.doc/ae/twlp_sec_ssl.html?cp=SSAW57_8.5.5%2F1-3-11-0-4-1-0).

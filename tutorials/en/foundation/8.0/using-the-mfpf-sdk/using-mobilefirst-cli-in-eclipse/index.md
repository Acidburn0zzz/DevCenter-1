## Overview

Using the Cordova CLI you can create and manage your Cordova applications. You can also achieve the same in the Eclipse IDE by using the [THyM](https://www.eclipse.org/thym/) plug-in.

THyM provides support for importing and managing Cordova projects in Eclipse. You can create new Cordova projects, as well as import existing Cordova projects. You can also install Cordova plug-ins into your project through this plug-in.

Learn more about THyM in its [official website](https://www.eclipse.org/thym/).

The MobileFirst Studio plug-in for Eclipse exposes the various MobileFirst commands in the Eclipse IDE.  
Specifically, it provides the following commands: Open Server Console, Preview App, Register App, Encrypt App, Pull App, Push App, Update App.

This tutorial walks you through installing the THyM and MobileFirst Eclipse plug-ins.

**Prerequisites:**  

* MobileFirst Server to run locally, or a remotely running MobileFirst Server.
* MobileFirst CLI installed on the developer workstation

## Overview
{: #overview }
This tutorial provides step-by-step instructions to set up a {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} instance on Bluemix by using the {{ site.data.keys.mf_bm_full }} (**{{ site.data.keys.mf_bm_short }}**) service.  
{{ site.data.keys.mf_bm_short }} is a Bluemix service that enables quick and easy stand-up of scalable Developer or Production environments of MobileFirst Foundation v8.0 on **Liberty for Java runtime**.

The {{ site.data.keys.mf_bm_short }} service offers the following plan options:

1. **Developer**: This plan provisions a {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} as a Cloud Foundry app on a Liberty for Java runtime. The plan does not support the use of external databases or define multiple nodes *and is restricted to development and testing only*. The server instance allows you to register any number of Mobile application for development and testing.

    > **Note:** the Developer plan does not offer a persistent database, as such be sure to backup your configuration as explained [in the Troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting).

2. **Developer Pro**: This plan provisions a {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} as a Cloud Foundry app on a Liberty for Java runtime, and allows users to develop and test any number of mobile applications. The plan requires you to have a **dashDB OLTP service** in place. The dashDB service is created and billed separately. Optionally, you can add a {{ site.data.keys.mf_analytics_server }}, deployed on IBM Containers. The Container charges are billed separately. This plan is limited in size and is intended to be used for team-based development and testing activities, not production. Charges depend on the total size of your environment.

3. **Professional Per Capacity:** This plan allows users to build, test and run any number of mobile applications in production, regardless of the number of mobile users or devices. It supports large deployments and High Availability. The plan requires you to have a **dashDB OLTP service** in place. The dashDB service is created and billed separately. Optionally, you can add a {{ site.data.keys.mf_analytics_server }}, deployed on IBM Containers. The Container charges are billed separately. Charges depend on the total size of your environment.

4. **Professional 1 Application**: This plan provisions a {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} in a scalable Cloud Foundry app on a Liberty for Java runtime. The plan also requires a dashDB database service, which is created and billed separately. The plan allows users to build and manage a single mobile application. A single mobile application can consist of multiple flavors, such as iOS, Android, Windows, and Mobile Web.

## Troubleshooting
{: #troubleshooting }
The Developer plan does not offer a persistent database, which could cause at times loss of data. To quickly onboard in such cases, be sure to follow these best practices:

* Every time you make any of the following server-side actions:
    * Deploy an adapter or update any adapter configuration or property value
    * Perform any security configuration such scope-mapping and alike

    Run the following from the command-line to download your configuration to a .zip file:

  ```bash
  $curl -X GET -u admin:admin -o export.zip http://<App Name>.mybluemix.net/mfpadmin/management-apis/2.0/runtimes/mfp/export/all
  ```

* In case you recreate your server or lose your configuration, run the following from the command-line to import the configuration to the server:

  ```bash
  $curl -X POST -u admin:admin -F file=@./export.zip http://<App Name>.mybluemix.net/mfpadmin/management-apis/2.0/runtimes/mfp/deploy/multi
  ```

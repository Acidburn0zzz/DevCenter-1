## Overview
Follow the instructions below to configure a MobileFirst Server instance on a Liberty for Java runtime on Bluemix. (MobileFirst Analytics instance can be run on IBM containers only). To achieve this you will go through the following steps: 

* Setup your host computer with the required tools (Cloud Foundry CLI)
* Setup your Bluemix account
* Build a MobileFirst Server and push it to the Bluemix as a Cloud Foundry application.

Finally, you will register your mobile apps as well as deploy your adapters.

**Notes:**  

* Windows OS is currently not supported for running these scripts.  
* The MobileFirst Server Configuration tools cannot be used for deployments to IBM Containers.

## Register an account at Bluemix
If you do not have an account yet, visit the [Bluemix website](https://bluemix.net) and click **Get Started Free** or **Sign Up**. You need to fill up a registration form before you can move on to the next step.

### The Bluemix Dashboard
After signing in to Bluemix, you are presented with the Bluemix Dashboard, which provides an overview of the active Bluemix **space**. By default, this work area receives the name "dev". You can create multiple work areas/spaces if needed.

## Set up your host machine
To manage the Bluemix Cloud Foundry app, you need to install the Cloud Foundry CLI.
You can run the scripts using the macOS Terminal.app:

### Cloud Foundry CLI

1. Install the [Cloud Foundry CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases?cm_mc_uid=85906649576514533887001&cm_mc_sid_50200000=1454307195).

## Download the ibm-mfpf-container-8.0.0.0 archive
To set up IBM MobileFirst Foundation on IBM Containers, you must first create a file layout that will later be pushed to Bluemix.  
<a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg2C7000005" target="blank">Follow the instructions in this page</a> to download the IBM MobileFirst Server 8.0 for IBM Containers archive (.zip file, search for: *CNBL0EN*).

The archive file contains the files for building an file layout (**dependencies** and **mfpf-libs**), the files for building and deploying a MobileFirst Operational Analytics Container (**mfpf-analytics**) and files for configuring a MobileFirst Server Cloud Foundry app (**mfpf-server-libertyapp**).

## Setting Up the MobileFirst Server 
You can choose to run the scripts interactively or by using the configuration files:
A good place to start is to run the scripts interactively once, which will also record the arguments (**recorder-args**). You can later use the args files to run the scripts in a non interactive mode.
> Note: Passwords are not recorded and you will have to manually add the passwords to the argument files.

* Using the configuration files - run the scripts and pass the respective configuration file as an argument.
* Interactively - run the scripts without any arguments.

**Note:** If you choose to run the scripts interactively, you can skip the configuration but it is strongly suggested to at least read and understand the arguments that you will need to provide.

            <div class="panel-body">
            The <strong>args</strong> folder contains a set of configuration files which contain the arguments that are required to run the scripts. You can find the empty template files and the explanation of the arguments in the **args** folder, or post running the scripts interactively in the **recorded-args** folder. Following are the files:<br/>
            
              <h4>initenv.properties</h4>
              This file contains properties used to run the environment initialization.
              <h4>prepareserverdbs.properties</h4>
              The Mobile Foundation service requires an external <a href="https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/dashdb/" target="\_blank">dashDB Enterprise Transactional database</i> instance</a> (Any plan that is marked OLTP or Transactional).<br/>
              <b>Note:</b> The deployment of the dashDB Enterprise Transactional plans is immediate for the plans marked "pay as you go". Make sure you pick one of the suitable plans like <i>Enterprise for Transactions High Availability 2.8.500 (Pay per use)</i> <br/><br/>
              After you have set up your dashDB instance, provide the required arguments.
              
              <h4>prepareserver.properties</h4>
              This file is used for the prepareserver.sh script. This prepares the server file layout and pushes it to Bluemix as a Cloud Foundry app.
              <h4>startserver.properties</h4>
              This file configures tha runtime attributes of the server and starts is. It is strongly recomended that you use a minimum of 1024 MB (**SERVER_MEM=1024**) and 3 nodes for high availablilty (**INSTANCES=3**)

              <ol>
                  <li><strong>initenv.sh â Logging in to Bluemix </strong><br />
                      Run the <strong>initenv.sh</strong> script to login to Bluemix. Run this for the Org and space where your dashDB service is bound:
                        {% highlight bash %}
                        ./initenv.sh args/initenv.properties
                        {% endhighlight %}

                        You an also pass the parameters on the commandline
                        
                        {% highlight bash %}
                        initenv.sh --user Bluemix_user_ID --password Bluemix_password --org Bluemix_organization_name --space Bluemix_space_name

                  </li>
                  <li><strong>prepareserverdbs.sh - Prepare the MobileFirst Server database</strong><br />
                  The <strong>prepareserverdbs.sh</strong> script is used to configure your MobileFirst server with the dashDB database service or a accessible DB2 database server. The Db2 option is usable particularly when you are running BLuemix local in the same datacentre where you have the DB2 server installed. If using the dashDB service, the service instance of the dashDB service should be available in the Organization and Space that you logged in to in step 1. Run the following:
                        {% highlight bash %}
                        ./prepareserverdbs.sh args/prepareserverdbs.properties
                        {% endhighlight %}

                        You an also pass the parameters on the commandline

                        {% highlight bash %}

                      This step is required only if you need to create your server in a different Organization and Space than where the dashDB service instance is available. If yes, then update the initenv.properties with the new Organization and Space where the containers have to be created (and started), and rerun the <strong>initenv.sh</strong> script:
                        {% highlight bash %}

                        {% endhighlight %}

                        You an also pass the parameters on the commandline

                        {% highlight bash %}

Launch the MobileFirst Console by loading the following URL: http://APP_HOST.mybluemix.net/mfpconsole (it may take a few moments).  
Add the remote server by following the instructions in the [Using MobileFirst CLI to Manage MobileFirst Artifacts](../../using-the-mfpf-sdk/using-mobilefirst-cli-to-manage-mobilefirst-artifacts/#add-a-new-server-instance) tutorial.  

With MobileFirst Server running on IBM Bluemix, you can now start your application development. Review the MobileFirst Foundation [tutorials](../../all-tutorials).

#### Applying changes
You may need to apply changes to the server layout after you have deployed the server once, e.g: you want to update the analytics URL in /usr/config/mfpfproperties.xml. Makt the changes and then re-run the following scripts with the same set of arguments. 

1. ./prepareserver.sh 
2. ./startserver.sh 

## Applying MobileFirst Server Fixes
Interim fixes for the MobileFirst Server on IBM Containers can be obtained from [IBM Fix Central](http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral).  
Before you apply an interim fix, back up your existing configuration files. The configuration files are located in the 
**package_root/mfpf-server-libertyapp/usr** folders.

1. Download the interim fix archive and extract the contents to your existing installation folder, overwriting the existing files.
2. Restore your backed-up configuration files into the  **/mfpf-server-libertyapp/usr** folders, overwriting the newly installed configuration files.

You can now build and deploy the updatd server.

## Removing the database service configuration from Bluemix	
If you ran the **prepareserverdbs.sh** script during the configuration of the MobileFirst Server image, the configurations and database tables required for MobileFirst Server are created. This script also creates the database schema for the container.

To remove the database service configuration from Bluemix, perform the following procedure using Bluemix dashboard.

1. From the Bluemix dashboard, select the dashDB service you have used. Choose the dashDB service name that you had provided as parameter while running the **prepareserverdbs.sh** script.
2. Launch the dashDB console to work with the schemas and database objects of the selected dashDB service instance.
3. Select the schemas related to IBM MobileFirst Server configuration. The schema names are ones that you have provided as parameters while running the **prepareserverdbs.sh** script.
4. Delete each of the schema after carefully inspecting the schema names and the objects under them. The database configurations are removed from Bluemix.

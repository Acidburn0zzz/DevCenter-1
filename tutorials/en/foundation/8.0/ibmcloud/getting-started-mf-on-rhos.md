## Introduction
Mobile Foundation offers an industry-leading secured platform for developers to rapidly build and deploy the next generation of multi channel digital apps, including mobile, wearables, conversation, web, and PWAs.  Accelerate the development and deployment of powerful, engaging digital apps with: -
* Containerized mobile back-end services for OpenShift Container Platform covering comprehensive security, application life cycle management, offline data sync and back-end integration.
* Low-code studio to build digital apps and rich SDKs for widely used mobile frameworks both native and hybrid developers.
* A private App Store to publish your apps for consumption by users
* User engagement by means of  analytics service for application insights, feedback using In-App feedback, Push notifications, Feature Toggle and A/B testing. 

## Installing Mobile Foundation
{: #install-mf}

To install Mobile Foundation on an existing OpenShift cluster follow the instructions [here](../).

## Developing Applications
{: #develop-apps}

You can quickly and easily develop Mobile Applications that use Mobile Foundation Lifecycle Management, Security, Engagement and Analytics by using the IBM Digital App Builder (DAB) Tool.  DAB also provides mobile application accelerators for secure connectivity to backend microservices.  

* Onboard to Digital App Builder Tool and it's capabilities
* Build and Test your first Mobile Foundation Application within minutes

## Deploying Applications
{: #deploying-apps}
Every Mobile Foundation Application has two deployables: - 
* Mobile Client Applications which can be deployed to the Mobile Foundation App Center or any other public App Store
* Mobile Foundation Service Configurations for Application Lifecycle, Security, Push Notifications, LiveUpdate.  These configurations can be exported from Mobile Foundation development enviroment and imported into a Mobile Foundation staging or production environment.

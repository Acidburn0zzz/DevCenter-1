## Overview
{: #overview }

IBM Mobile Foundation for Developers 8.0 on {{ site.data.keys.prod_icp }} is a developer edition of Mobile Foundation, which comprises of Mobile Foundation server and Operational Analytics components. The server runtime has an in-built Derby database to store the Mobile Foundation data. This restricts the users to one pod in the Kubernetes deployment on {{ site.data.keys.prod_icp }}. Community Edition provides Mobile Foundation users a developer experience with minimal configuration parameters and ease of setting up of the Mobile Foundation  instance on {{ site.data.keys.prod_icp }} .

Follow the instructions below to install the developer edition of IBM Mobile Foundation server with pre-configured Operational Analytics on {{ site.data.keys.prod_icp }}:<br/>
* Setup IBM Cloud Private Kubernetes Cluster (IBM Cloud Private CE or Native/Enterprise).
* [Optional] Setup your host computer with the required tools â€“ Docker CLI, IBM Cloud CLI (cloudctl), Kubernetes CLI (kubectl), and Helm CLI (helm).

## Prerequisites
{: #prereqs}

You should have IBM Cloud Private (Community Edition or Native/Enterprise) set up  and ready. Refer to [IBM Cloud Private Cluster installation](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSBS6K_3.1.1/installing/install.html) documentation for setup instructions.

To manage containers and images, you need to install the following tools on your host machine as part of {{ site.data.keys.prod_icp }} setup:

* Docker
* IBM Cloud CLI (`cloudctl`)
* Kubernetes CLI (`kubectl`)
* Helm (`helm`)

To access {{ site.data.keys.prod_icp }} Cluster using CLI, you should configure the *kubectl* client. [Learn more](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSBS6K_3.1.0/manage_cluster/cfc_cli.html).


## Install and configure IBM Mobile Foundation for Developers 8.0 Helm Chart
{: #install-the-ibm-mfpf-icp-catalog}

Please follow  the procedure in [Deploying Helm charts in the Catalog](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSBS6K_3.1.1/app_center/create_release.html), to install IBM Mobile Foundation for Developers 8.0 (**ibm-mobilefoundation-dev**) helm chart from the Catalog.

### Environment variables for IBM Mobile Foundation for Developers 8.0
{: #env-mf-developers }
The table below provides the environment variables used in IBM Mobile Foundation for Developers 8.0.

| Qualifier | Parameter | Definition | Allowed Value |
|-----------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| arch |  | Worker node architecture | Worker node architecture to which this chart should be deployed.<br/>Only **AMD64** platform is currently supported. |
| image | pullPolicy | Image Pull Policy | Always, Never, or IfNotPresent. <br/>Default is **IfNotPresent**. |
|  | repository | Docker image name | Name of the {{ site.data.keys.prod_adj }} server docker image. |
|  | tag | Docker image tag | See [Docker tag description](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/image_tag/) |
| resources | limits.cpu | Describes the maximum amount of CPU allowed | Default is 2000m. See Kubernetes - [meaning of CPU](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-compute-resources-container/#meaning-of-cpu). |
|  | limits.memory | Describes the maximum amount of memory allowed | Default is 4096Mi. See Kubernetes - [meaning of memory](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-compute-resources-container/#meaning-of-memory). |
|  | requests.cpu | Describes the minimum amount of CPU required - if not specified will default to limit (if specified) or otherwise implementation-defined value | Default is 2000m. See Kubernetes - [meaning of CPU](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-compute-resources-container/#meaning-of-cpu). |
|  | requests.memory | Describes the minimum amount of memory required. If not specified, the memory amount will default to the limit (if specified) or the implementation-defined value | Default is 2048Mi. See Kubernetes - [meaning of memory](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-compute-resources-container/#meaning-of-memory). |
| logs | consoleFormat | Specifies container log output format. | Default is **json**. |
|  | consoleLogLevel | Controls the granularity of messages that go to the container log. | Default is **info**. |
|  | consoleSource | Specify sources that are written to the container log. Use a comma separated list for multiple sources. | Default is **message**, **trace**, **accessLog**, **ffdc**. |

## Verifying the Installation
{: #verify-install}

After you have installed Mobile Foundation for Developers 8.0, you can verify your installation and the status of the deployed pods by doing the following:

In the {{ site.data.keys.prod_icp }} Management Console. Select **Workloads > Helm Releases**. Click on the *release name* of your installation.


## Accessing {{ site.data.keys.prod_adj }} console
{: #access-mf-console}

After successful installation you can access, IBM {{ site.data.keys.prod_adj }} Operational Console using `<protocol>://<ip_address>:<port>/mfpconsole`.
IBM {{ site.data.keys.mf_analytics }} Console can be accessed using `<protocol>://<ip_address>:<port>/analytics/console`.

The protocol can be `http` or `https`. Also, note that, the port will be **NodePort** in the case of **NodePort** deployment. To get the ip_address and **NodePort** of your installed {{ site.data.keys.prod_adj }} Charts, follow the steps below:

1. In {{ site.data.keys.prod_icp }} Management Console, select **Workloads > Helm Releases**.
2. Click on the *release name* of your helm chart installation.
3. See the **Notes** section.

## Sample application
{: #sample-app}
See the [{{ site.data.keys.prod_adj }} tutorials](https://mobilefirstplatform.ibmcloud.com/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/all-tutorials/), to deploy the sample adapter and to run the sample application on IBM {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} running on {{ site.data.keys.prod_icp }},

## Uninstall
{: #uninstall}
To uninstall {{ site.data.keys.mf_server }} and {{ site.data.keys.mf_analytics }}, use the [Helm CLI](https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#installing-helm).

From the Dashboard, click **Workloads > Helm Releases**, search for the *release_name* used to deploy the chart, and click the **Action** menu and choose **Delete** to completely delete the installed charts.

Use the following command to completely delete the installed charts and the associated deployments:
```bash
helm delete --purge <release_name>
```
*release_name* is the deployed release name of the Helm Chart.

## Limitations
{: #limitations}

This Helm chart is provided only for development and testing purposes. Data is stored in the embedded Derby database. The chart works with only one pod due to the database restrictions.

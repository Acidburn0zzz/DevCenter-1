##Overview
From [http://cordova.apache.org/](http://cordova.apache.org/):
> Apache Cordova is an open-source mobile development framework. It allows you to use standard web technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for cross-platform development, avoiding each mobile platforms' native development language. Applications execute within wrappers targeted to each platform, and rely on standards-compliant API bindings to access each device's sensors, data, and network status.

IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation provides an SDK in the form of a standard Cordova plug-in which can be installed in your Cordova application.  
The MobileFirst SDK feature set, including:

* Cross-platform UI elements such as TabBar and SimpleDialog
* Ability to navigate between web and native views and/or call Native code using the MobileFirst SendAction API
* Share session data between web and native views
* Call Resource Requests to retrieve data from any backend
* Protect applications using MobileFirst Security checks
* And more...

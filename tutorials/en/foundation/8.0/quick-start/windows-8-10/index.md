## Overview
The purpose of this demonstration is to experience an end-to-end flow:

1. A sample application that is pre-bundled with the MobileFirst client SDK is registered and downloaded from the MobileFirst Operations Console.
2. A new or provided adapter is deployed to the MobileFirst Operations Console.  
3. The application logic is changed to make a resource request.

**End result**:

* Successfully pinging the MobileFirst Server.
* Successfully retrieving data using a MobileFirst Adapter.

#### Prerequisites:

* Configured Visual Studio 2013/5
* *Optional*. MobileFirst CLI ([download]({{site.baseurl}}/downloads))
* *Optional*. Stand-alone MobileFirst Server ([download]({{site.baseurl}}/downloads))

### 1. Starting the MobileFirst Server
Make sure you have [created a Mobile Foundation instance](../../ibm-containers/using-mobile-foundation), or  
If using the [MobileFirst Foundation Development Kit](../../setting-up-your-development-environment/mobilefirst-development-environment), navigate to the server's folder and run the command: `./run.cmd`.

### 2. Creating an application

In a browser window, open the MobileFirst Operations Console by loading the URL: `http://your-server-host:server-port/mfpconsole`. If running locally, use: [http://localhost:9080/mfpconsole](http://localhost:9080/mfpconsole). The username/password are *admin/admin*.

1. Click the **New** button next to **Applications**
    * Select a **Windows** platform
    * Enter **MFPStarterCSharp.Windows** as the **application identifier** for Windows, or **MFPStarterCSharp.WindowsPhone** for Windows Phone
    * Enter **1.0.0** as the **version** value
    * Click on **Register application**

2. Click on the **Get Starter Code** tile and select to download the Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 sample application.

### 3. Editing application logic

1. Open the Visual Studio project.

2. Select the solution's **MainPage.xaml.cs** file and paste the following code snippet into the GetAccessToken() method:

    ```csharp
    try
      {
          IWorklightClient _newClient = WorklightClient.CreateInstance();
          accessToken = await _newClient.AuthorizationManager.ObtainAccessToken("");
          if (accessToken.IsValidToken && accessToken.Value != null && accessToken.Value != "")
          {
              System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine("Received the following access token value: " + accessToken.Value);
              titleTextBlock.Text = "Yay!";
              statusTextBlock.Text = "Connected to MobileFirst Server";

              Uri adapterPath = new Uri("/adapters/javaAdapter/resource/greet",UriKind.Relative);
              WorklightResourceRequest request = _newClient.ResourceRequest(adapterPath, "GET","");
              request.SetQueryParameter("name", "world");
              WorklightResponse response = await request.Send();

              System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine("Success: " + response.ResponseText);

            }
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            titleTextBlock.Text = "Uh-oh";
            statusTextBlock.Text = "Client failed to connect to MobileFirst Server";
            System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine("An error occurred: '{0}'", e);
        }
    ```


### 4. Deploy an adapter
Download [this prepared .adapter artifact](../javaAdapter.adapter) and deploy it from the MobileFirst Operations Console using the **Actions → Deploy adapter** action.

<!-- Alternatively, click the **New** button next to **Adapters**.  

1. Select the **Actions → Download sample** option. Download the "Hello World" **Java** adapter sample.

    > If Maven and MobileFirst CLI are not installed, follow the on-screen **Set up your development environment** instructions.

2. From a **Command-line** window, navigate to the adapter's Maven project root folder and run the command:

    ```bash
    mfpdev adapter build
    ```

3. When the build finishes, deploy it from the MobileFirst Operations Console using the **Actions → Deploy adapter** action. The adapter can be found in the **[adapter]/target** folder.

### 5. Testing the application

1. In Visual Studio, select the **mfpclient.resw** file and edit the **protocol**, **host** and **port** properties with the correct values for your MobileFirst Server.
    * If using a local MobileFirst Server, the values are typically **http**, **localhost** and **9080**.
    * If using a remote MobileFirst Server (on Bluemix), the values are typically **https**, **your-server-address** and **443**.

    Alternatively, if you have installed the MobileFirst CLI, then navigate to the project root folder and run the command `mfpdev app register`. If a remote MobileFirst Server is used, [run the command `mfpdev server add`](../../using-the-mfpf-sdk/using-mobilefirst-cli-to-manage-mobilefirst-artifacts/#add-a-new-server-instance) to add the server, followed by for example: `mfpdev app register myBluemixServer`.

2. Press the **Run App** button.

### Results
* Clicking the **Ping MobileFirst Server** button will display **Connected to MobileFirst Server**.
* If the application was able to connect to the MobileFirst Server, a resource request call using the deployed Java adapter will take place.

The adapter response is then printed in Visual Studio's Outpout console.

## Overview
This tutorial explains the steps a developer needs to follow to be able to develop and test native C# Xamarin applications for Android or iOS devices. These steps include installing Xamarin Studio.

**Prerequisite:** As you setup your Xamarin development environment, make sure to also read the [Setting up the MobileFirst development environment](../../development/) tutorial.

### Development
Xamarin applications are developed using [Xamarin Studio] (https://www.xamarin.com/studio) or [Microsoft Visual Studio] (https://www.visualstudio.com/). Xamarin studio can be installed on Mac or Windows.  Alternatively, on Windows 8.1 or 10 desktops, Xamarin can be added as a plugin to Microsoft Visual Studio.   



Xamarin Studio can be downloaded at [Xamarin Studio Downloads](https://www.xamarin.com/download)

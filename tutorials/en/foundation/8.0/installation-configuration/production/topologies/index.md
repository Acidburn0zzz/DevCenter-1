## Overview
The information presented here details possible server topologies for MobileFirst Server components, as well as available network flows.  
The components are deployed according to the server topology that you use. The network flows explain to you how the components communicate with one another and with the end-user devices.

## Network flows between the MobileFirst Server components
The MobileFirst Server components can communicate with each other over JMX or HTTP. You need to configure certain JNDI properties to enable the communications.  
The network flows between the components and the device can be illustrated by the following image:

### MobileFirst runtime to MobileFirst Server administration service
The runtime and the administration service can communicate with each other through JMX and HTTP. This communication occurs during the initialization phase of the runtime. The runtime contacts the administration service local to its application server to get the list of the adapters and applications that it needs to serve. The communication also happens when some administration operations are run from MobileFirst Operations Console or the administration service. On WebSphereÂ® Application Server Network Deployment, the runtime can contact an administration service that is installed on another server of the cell. This enables the non-symmetric deployment (see [Constraints on MobileFirst Server administration service, MobileFirst Server live update service and MobileFirst runtime]()). However, on all other application servers (Apache Tomcat, WebSphere Application Server Liberty, or stand-alone WebSphere Application Server), the administration service must be running on the same server as the runtime.

The protocols for JMX depend on the application server:

* Apache Tomcat - RMI
* WebSphere Application Server Liberty - HTTPS (with the REST connector)
* WebSphere Application Server - SOAP or RMI

For the communication via JMX, it is required that these protocols are available on the application server. For more information about the requirements, see [Application server prerequisites]().

The JMX beans of the runtime and the administration service are obtained from the application server. However, in the case of WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment, the JMX beans are obtained from the deployment manager. The deployment manager has the view of all the beans of a cell on WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment. As such, some configurations are not needed on WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment (such as the farm configuration), and non-symmetric deployment is possible on WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment. For more information, see [Constraints on MobileFirst Server administration service, MobileFirst Server live update service and MobileFirst runtime]().

To distinguish different installation of MobileFirst Server on the same application server or on the same WebSphere Application Server cell, you can use an environment ID, which is a JNDI variable. By default, this variable has an empty value. A runtime with a given environment ID communicates only with an administration service that has the same environment ID. For example, the administration service has an environment ID set to X, and the runtime has a different environment ID (for example, Y), then the two components do not see each other. The MobileFirst Operations Console shows no runtime available.

An administration service must be able to communicate with all the MobileFirst runtime components of a cluster. When an administration operation is run, such as uploading a new version of an adapter, or changing the active status of an application, all runtime components of the cluster must be notified about the change. If the application server is not WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment, this communication can happen only if a farm is configured. For more information, see [Constraints on MobileFirst Server administration service, MobileFirst Server live update service and MobileFirst runtime].

The runtime also communicates with the administration service through HTTP or HTTPS to download large artifacts such as the adapters. A URL is generated by the administration service and the runtime opens and outbound HTTP or HTTPS connection to request an artifact from this URL. It is possible to override the default URL generation by defining the JNDI properties (mfp.admin.proxy.port, mfp.admin.proxy.protocol, and mfp.admin.proxy.host) in the administration service. The administration service might also need to communicate with the runtime through HTTP or HTTPS to get the OAuth tokens that are used to run the push operations. For more information, see [MobileFirst Server administration service to MobileFirst Server push service, and to the authorization server](#mobilefirst-server-administration-service-to-mobilefirst-server-push-service-,-and-to-the-authorization-server).

The JNDI properties that are used for the communication between the runtime and the administration service are as follows:

#### MobileFirst Server administration service

* [JNDI properties for administration services: JMX]()
* [JNDI properties for administration services: proxies]()
* [JNDI properties for administration services: topologies]()

#### MobileFirst runtime

* [List of JNDI properties for MobileFirst runtime]()

### MobileFirst Server administration service to MobileFirst runtime in other servers
As described in [MobileFirst runtime to MobileFirst Server administration service](mobilefirst-runtime-to-mobilefirst-server-administration-service), it is required to have the communication between an administration service and all the runtime components of a cluster. When an administration operation is run, all the runtime components of a cluster can then be notified about this modification. The communication is through JMX.

On WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment, this communication can occur without any specific configuration. All the JMX MBeans that correspond to the same environment ID are obtained from the deployment manager.

For a cluster of stand-alone WebSphere Application Server, WebSphere Application Server Liberty profile, or Apache Tomcat, the communication can happen only if a farm is configured. For more information, see [Installing a server farm].

### MobileFirst Server administration service and MobileFirst runtime to the deployment manager on WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment
On WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment, the runtime and the administration service obtain the JMX MBeans that are used in [MobileFirst runtime to MobileFirst Server administration service](#mobilefirst-runtime-to-mobilefirst-server-administration-service) and [MobileFirst Server administration service to MobileFirst runtime in other servers](#mobilefirst-server-administration-service-to-mobilefirst-runtime-in-other-servers) by communicating with the deployment manager. The corresponding JNDI properties are **mfp.admin.jmx.dmgr.*** in [JNDI properties for administration services: JMX]().

The deployment manager must be running to allow the operations that require JMX communication between the runtime and the administration service. Such operations can be a runtime initialization, or the notification of a modification performed through the administration service.

### MobileFirst Server push service and MobileFirst runtime to MobileFirst Analytics
The runtime sends data to MobileFirst Analytics through HTTP or HTTPS. The JNDI properties of the runtime that are used to define this communication are:

* **mfp.analytics.url** - the URL that is exposed by MobileFirst Analytics service to receive incoming analytics data from the runtime. Example: `http://<hostname>:<port>/analytics-service/rest`

    When MobileFirst Analytics is installed as a cluster, the data can be sent to any member of the cluster.

* **mfp.analytics.username** - the user name that is used to access MobileFirst Analytics service. The analytics service is protected by a security role.
* **mfp.analytics.password** - the password to access the analytics service.
* **mfp.analytics.console.url** - the URL that is passed to MobileFirst Operations Console to display a link to MobileFirst Analytics Console. Example: `http://<hostname>:<port>/analytics/console`

    The JNDI properties of the push service that are used to define this communication are:
    * **mfp.push.analytics.endpoint** - the URL that is exposed by MobileFirst Analytics service to receive incoming analytics data from the push service. Example: `http://<hostname>:<port>/analytics-service/rest`

    When MobileFirst Analytics is installed as a cluster, the data can be sent to any member of the cluster.
    
    * **mfp.push.analytics.username** - the user name that is used to access MobileFirst Analytics service. The analytics service is protected a security role.
    * **mfp.push.analytics.password** - the password to access the analytics service.

### MobileFirst Server administration service to MobileFirst Server live update service
The administration service communicates with the live update service to store and retrieve configuration information about the MobileFirst artifacts. The communication is performed through HTTP or HTTPS.

The URL to contact the live update service is automatically generated by the administration service. Both services must be on the same application server. The context root of the live update service must define in this way: `<adminContextRoot>config`. For example, if the context root of the administration service is **mfpadmin**, then the context root of the live update service must be **mfpadminconfig***. It is possible to override the default URL generation by defining the JNDI properties (**mfp.admin.proxy.port**, **mfp.admin.proxy.protocol**, and **mfp.admin.proxy.host**) in the administration service.

The JNDI properties to configure this communication between the two services are:

* **mfp.config.service.user**
* **mfp.config.service.password**
* And those properties in [JNDI properties for administration services: proxies]().

### MobileFirst Operations Console to MobileFirst Server administration service
MobileFirst Operations Console is a web user interface and acts as the front end to the administration service. It communicates with the REST services of the administration service through HTTP or HTTPS. The users who are allowed to use the console, must also be allowed to use the administration service. Each user that is mapped to a certain security role of the console must also be mapped to the same security role of the service. With this setup, the requests from the console can thus be accepted by the service.

The JNDI properties to configure this communication are in [JNDI properties for the MobileFirst Operations Console]().

> Note: The **mfp.admin.endpoint** property enables the console to locate the administration service. You can use the asterisk character (*) as wildcard for specifying that the URL, generated by the console to contact the administration services, use the same value as the incoming HTTP request to the console. For example: `*://*:*/mfpadmin` means use the same protocol, host, and port as the console, but use **mfpadmin** as context root. This property is specified for the console application.

### MobileFirst Server administration service to MobileFirst Server push service, and to the authorization server
The administration service communicates with the push service to request various push operations. This communication is secured through the OAuth protocol. Both services need to be registered as confidential clients. An initial registration can be performed at installation time. In this process, both services need to contact an authorization server. This authorization server can be MobileFirst runtime.

The JNDI properties of the administration service to configure this communication are:

* **mfp.admin.push.url** - the URL of the push service.
* **mfp.admin.authorization.server.url** - the URL of the MobileFirst authorization server.
* **mfp.admin.authorization.client.id** - the client ID of the administration service, as an OAuth confidential client.
* **mfp.admin.authorization.client.secret** - the secret code that is used to get the OAuth-based tokens.

> Note: The mfp.push.authorization.client.id and mfp.push.authorization.client.secret properties of the administration service can be used to register the push service automatically as a confidential client when the administration service starts. The push service must be configured with the same values.

The JNDI properties of the push service to configure this communication are:

* **mfp.push.authorization.server.url** - the URL of the MobileFirst authorization server. Same as the property **mfp.admin.authorization.server.url**.
* **mfp.push.authorization.client.id** - the client ID of the push service to contact the authorization server.
* **mfp.push.authorization.client.secret** - the secret code that is used to contact the authorization server.

### MobileFirst Server push service to an external push notification service (outbound)
The push service generates outbound traffic to the external notification service such as Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) or Google Cloud Messaging (GCM). This communication can also be done through a proxy. Depending on the notification service, the following JNDI properties must be set:

* **push.apns.proxy.***
* **push.gcm.proxy.***

For more information, see [List of JNDI properties for MobileFirst Server push service]().

### Mobile devices to MobileFirst runtime
The mobile devices contact the runtime. The security of this communication is determined by the configuration of the application and the adapters that are requested. For more information, see [MobileFirst security framework](../../../authentication-and-security).

## Constraints on the MobileFirst Server components and MobileFirst Analytics
Understand the constraints on the various MobileFirst Server components and MobileFirst Analytics before you decide your server topology.

* [Constraints on MobileFirst Server administration service, MobileFirst Server live update service and MobileFirst runtime](#constraints-on-mobilefirst-server-administration-service-mobilefirst-server-live-update-service-and-mobilefirst-runtime)
* [Constraints on MobileFirst Server push service](#constraints-on-mobilefirst-server-push-service)

### Constraints on MobileFirst Server administration service, MobileFirst Server live update service and MobileFirst runtime
Find out the constraints and the deployment mode of the administration service, live update service, and the runtime per server topology.

The live update service must be always installed with the administration service on the same application server as explained in [MobileFirst Server administration service to MobileFirst Server live update service](#mobilefirst-server-administration-service-to-mobilefirst-server-live-update-service). The context root of the live update service must define in this way: `/<adminContextRoot>config`. For example, if the context root of the administration service is **/mfpadmin**, then the context root of the live update service must be **/mfpadminconfig**.

You can use the following topologies of application servers:

* Stand-alone server: WebSphereÂ® Application Server Liberty profile, Apache Tomcat, or WebSphere Application Server full profile
* Server farm: WebSphere Application Server Liberty profile, Apache Tomcat, or WebSphere Application Server full profile
* WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment cell
* Liberty collective

#### Modes of deployment
Depending on the application server topology that you use, you have two modes of deployment choice for deploying the administration service, the live update service and the runtime in the application server infrastructure. In asymmetric deployment, you can install the runtimes on different application servers from the administration and the live update services.

**Symmetric deployment**  
In symmetrical deployment, you must install the MobileFirst administration components (MobileFirst Operations Console, the administration service, and the live update service applications) and the runtime on the same application server.

**Asymmetric deployment**  
In asymmetric deployment, you can install the runtimes on different application servers from the MobileFirst administration components.  
Asymmetric deployment is only supported for WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment cell topology and for Liberty collective topology.

#### Select a topology

* [Stand-alone server topology](#stand-alone-server-topology)
* [Server farm topology](#server-farm-topology)
* [Liberty collective topology](#liberty-collective-topology)
* [WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment topologies](#websphere-application-server-network-deployment-topologies)
* [Using a reverse proxy with server farm and WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment topologies](#using-a-reverse-proxy-with-server-farm-and-websphere-application-server-network-deployment-topologies)

### Stand-alone server topology
You can configure a stand-alone topology for WebSphereÂ® Application Server full profile, WebSphere Application Server Liberty profile, and Apache Tomcat.
In this topology, all the administration components and the runtimes are deployed in a single Javaâ¢ Virtual Machine (JVM).

![Stand-alone topology](standalone_topology.jpg)

With one JVM, only symmetric deployment is possible with the following characteristics:

* One or several administration components can be deployed. Each MobileFirst Operations Console communicates with one administration service and one live update service.
* One or several runtimes can be deployed.
* One MobileFirst Operations Console can manage several runtimes.
* One runtime is managed by only one MobileFirst Operations Console.
* Each administration service uses its own administration database schema.
* Each live update service uses its own live update database schema.
* Each runtime uses its own runtime database schema.

#### Configuration of JNDI properties
Some JNDI properties are required to enable Java Management Extensions (JMX) communication between the administration service and the runtime, and to define the administration service that manages a runtime. For details about these properties, see [List of JNDI properties for MobileFirst Server administration service]() and [List of JNDI properties for MobileFirst runtime]().

**Stand-alone WebSphere Application Server Liberty profile server**  
The following global JNDI properties are required for the administration services and the runtimes.

| JNDI properties          | Values |
|--------------------------|--------|
| mfp.topology.platform	   | Liberty |
| mfp.topology.clustermode | Standalone |
| mfp.admin.jmx.host       | The host name of the WebSphere Application Server Liberty profile server. |
| mfp.admin.jmx.port       | The port of the REST connector that is the port of the httpsPort attribute declared in the <httpEndpoint> element of the server.xml file of WebSphere Application Server Liberty profile server. This property has no default value. |
| mfp.admin.jmx.user       | The user name of the WebSphere Application Server Liberty administrator, which must be identical to the name defined in the <administrator-role> element of the server.xml file of the WebSphere Application Server Liberty profile server. |
| mfp.admin.jmx.pwd        | The password of the WebSphere Application Server Liberty administrator user. |

Several administration components can be deployed to enable the same JVM to run on separate administration components that manage different runtimes.

When you deploy several administration components, you must specify:

* On each administration service, a unique value for the local **mfp.admin.environmentid** JNDI property.
* On each runtime, the same value for the local **mfp.admin.environmentid** JNDI property as the value defined for the administration service that manages the runtime.

**Stand-alone Apache Tomcat server**
The following local JNDI properties are required for the administration services and the runtimes.

| JNDI properties        |	Values    |
|------------------------|------------|
|mfp.topology.platform   | Tomcat     |
mfp.topology.clustermode | Standalone |

JVM properties are also required to define Java Management Extensions (JMX) Remote Method Invocation (RMI). For more information, see [Configuring JMX connection for Apache Tomcat]().

If the Apache Tomcat server is running behind a firewall, the **mfp.admin.rmi.registryPort** and **mfp.admin.rmi.serverPort** JNDI properties are required for the administration service. See [Configuring JMX connection for Apache Tomcat]().

Several administration components can be deployed to enable the same JVM to run on separate administration components that manage different runtimes.  
When you deploy several administration components, you must specify:

* On each administration service, a unique value for the local mfp.admin.environmentid JNDI property.
* On each runtime, the same value for the local mfp.admin.environmentid JNDI property as the value defined for the administration service that manages the runtime.

**Stand-alone WebSphere Application Server**  
The following local JNDI properties are required for the administration services and the runtimes.

| JNDI properties          | Values                 |
|--------------------------| -----------------------|
| mfp.topology.platform    | WAS                    |
| mfp.topology.clustermode | Standalone             |
| mfp.admin.jmx.connector  | The JMX connector type; the value can be SOAP or RMI. |

Several administration components can be deployed to enable the same JVM to run on separate administration components that manage different runtimes.  
When you deploy several administration components, you must specify:

* On each administration service, a unique value for the **local mfp.admin.environmentid** JNDI property.
* On each runtime, the same value for the local **mfp.admin.environmentid** JNDI property as the value defined for the administration service that manages the runtime.

### Server farm topology

### Constraints on MobileFirst Server push service
The push service can be on the same application server as the administration service or the runtime, or can be on a different application server. The URL used by the client apps to contact the push service is the same as the URL used by the client apps to contact the runtime, excepted that the context root of the runtime is replaced by imfpush. If you install the push service on a different server than the runtime, your HTTP server must direct the traffic to the /imfpush context root to a server where the push service runs.

For more information about the JNDI properties that are needed to adapt the installation to a topology, see [MobileFirst Server administration service to MobileFirst Server push service, and to the authorization server](#mobilefirst-server-administration-service-to-mobilefirst-server-push-service-and-to-the-authorization-server). The push service must be installed with the context root **/imfpush**.

## Multiple MobileFirst runtimes
You can install multiple runtimes. Each runtime must have its own context root, and all of these runtimes are managed by the same MobileFirst Server administration service and MobileFirst Operations Console.

The constraints as described in [Constraints on MobileFirst Server administration service, MobileFirst Server live update service and MobileFirst runtime]() applies. Each runtime (with its context root) must have its own database tables.

## Multiple instances of MobileFirst Server on the same server or WebSphere Application Server cell
By defining a common environment ID, multiple instances of MobileFirst Server are possible to be installed on the same server.

You can install multiple instances of MobileFirst Server administration service, MobileFirst Server live update service, and MobileFirst runtime on the same application server or WebSphereÂ® Application Server cell. However, you must distinguish their installations with the JNDI variable: mfp.admin.environmentid, which is a variable of the administration service and of the runtime. The administration service manages only the runtimes that have the same environment identifier. As such, only the runtime components and the administration service that have the same value for mfp.admin.environmentid are considered as part of the same installation.

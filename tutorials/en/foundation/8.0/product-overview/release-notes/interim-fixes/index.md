Interim fixes provide patches and updates to correct problems and keep IBM MobileFirst Foundation current for new releases of mobile operating systems.

Interim fixes are cumulative. When you download the latest v8.0 interim fix, you get all of the fixes from earlier interim fixes.

Download and install the latest interim fix to obtain all of the fixes that are described in the following sections. If you install earlier fixes, you might not get all of the fixes described here.

Where an APAR number is listed, you can confirm that an interim fix has that feature by searching the interim fix README file for that APAR number.

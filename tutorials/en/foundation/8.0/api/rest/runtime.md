The REST API for the {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} runtime provides several services for mobile clients and confidential clients to call adapters, obtain access tokens, get Direct Update content, and more. Most of the REST API endpoints are protected by OAuth.

### Testing the REST API for the MobileFirst runtime with Swagger UI
On a development server, you can test the runtime REST API with Swagger UI. {{ site.data.keys.product_adj }} exposes the runtime REST API at the /doc endpoint: [http(s)://server_ip:server_port/context_root/doc](http(s)://server_ip:server_port/context_root/doc).

The MobileFirst Analytics public REST API is documented in Swagger.  
To view and interact with Swagger, deploy the analytics-service.war (in the devcenter is it pre-deployed) file and load the following address in your browser: [http://hostname:port/analytics-service](http://hostname:port/analytics-service).

* Make sure to replace **hostname** and **port** with your server values.

## Alerts
Operational Analytics allows you to thresholds in alert definitions in the IBM MobileFirstâ„¢ Platform Operational Analytics Console to better monitor your activities.

You can configure thresholds, which if exceeded, trigger alerts to notify the MobileFirst Operational Analytics Console monitor. The triggered alerts can be visualized on the console, or the alerts can be handled by a custom webhook.

## Alerts
If you are using the latest interim fix of MobileFirst, you can set thresholds in alert definitions in the IBM MobileFirstâ„¢ Platform Operational Analytics Console to better monitor your activities.

You can configure thresholds, which if exceeded, trigger alerts to notify the MobileFirst Operational Analytics Console monitor. The triggered alerts can be visualized on the console, or the alerts can be handled by a custom webhook. This feature provides a proactive means of detecting client log errors, server log errors, extended periods of network latency, and authentication failures. Reactive thresholds and alerts keep you from having to sift through your data and set thresholds at a wide spectrum of granularity.

#### Navigating Alerts
To navigate to the Alert's dashboard there is a button with a bell in the top right corner as indicated in the picture below. The button may have a number associated, like in the image below. This number represents the number of alerts that have gone off since the last time last time a user has marked that they were notified of the alerts.

The initial page to the Alert's dashboard is the Alert's log page. In the Alert's log page you can see previous alerts that  you were alerted about. If an alert has not been marked as viewed, then you will see a red circle over the alert count. To mark this as viewed, just press on the red circle.

If you navigate to the **Alert Management** tab, you can see the previous alerts that have been created. Here you can enable the alerts, copy the alerts for a starting point when creating a new alert, edit an existing alert, delete an existing alert, or create a new alert.

#### Creating an Alert

To create an alert, press the **Create Alert** button under the **Alert Management** tab in the Alert's dashboard. When creating an alert, the alert's information will populate as you are filling in information because not every alert will take the same values. Below you can see an alert with information already filled in.

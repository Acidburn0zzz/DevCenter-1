### Migration

MobileFirst Platform Foundation Analytics now has a simple migration tool for users who are on an earlier version of Operational Analytics than MobileFirst Platform Foundation 7.1.0. This feature is needed because some of the search mappings in previous versions of IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation that are necessary to populate the Analytics console have been changed.

To run this search, go to the **administration** tab on the left side of the console. After the administration console loads, click the **Migration** tab on the top tab bar. You can then see how many documents you have to migrate and the progress of the migration. You can perform a migration by pressing the **Perform Migration** button. After the migration process, all your data is migrated to IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation 7.1.0 with all the correct mappings. You can see an example of the migration tab below.

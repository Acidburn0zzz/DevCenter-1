* [Enabling/Disabling Client Events](#enabling-disabling-client-event-types)
* [Custom Events](#custom-events)

## Configuring Analytics on the Client Side
Before you can start collecting the predefined data that MobileFirst Operational Analytics provides, you must first import the corresponding libraries to initialize the analytics support.

### JavaScript (Cordova)
* In Cordova applications, no setup is required and initialization is built-in.  

### JavaScript (Web)
* In Web applications, the analytics JavaScript files must be referenced. Make sure you have first added the MobileFirst Web SDK. Review the [Adding the MobileFirst SDK to Web applications](../../adding-the-mfpf-sdk/web) tutorial.  
Depending on how you've added the MobileFirst Web SDK, proceed in either of the following ways:
	- Reference Analytics in the `HEAD` element:

	```html
	<head>
	    ...
	    <script type="text/javascript" src="node_modules/ibm-mfp-web-sdk/lib/analytics/ibmmfpfanalytics.js"></script>
	    <script type="text/javascript" src="node_modules/ibm-mfp-web-sdk/ibmmfpf.js"></script>
	</head>
	```

	Or, if using RequireJS, write:

	```javascript
	require.config({
		'paths': {
			'ibmmfpfanalytics': 'node_modules/ibm-mfp-web-sdk/lib/analytics/ibmmfpfanalytics',
			'mfp': 'node_modules/ibm-mfp-web-sdk/ibmmfpf'
		}
	});

	require(['ibmmfpfanalytics','mfp'], function(wlanalytics, WL) {
	    // application logic.
	});
	```

	Note that you can select your own namespace instead of "wlanalytics".

Please refer to the [API Reference topic](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSHS8R_8.0.0/com.ibm.worklight.apiref.doc/topics/r_apiref.html) in the user documentation.

### iOS
#### Import Analytics Library

```objc
import "WLAnalytics.h"
```

#### Initialize Analytics
No setup required. Pre-initialized by default.

### Android
#### Import AnalyticsLibrary

```java
import com.worklight.common.WLAnalytics;
```

#### Initialize Analytics
Inside the `onCreate` method of your main activity include:

```java
WLAnalytics.init(this.getApplication());
```

## Sending Analytics Data
Sending Analytics is a crucial step to see client-side analytics on the Analytics Server. When data is collected for Analytics, the analytics logs are stored in a log file on the client device. The data from the file is sent to the MobileFirst Analytics server after you use the `send` method of the Analytics API.

### JavaScript (Cordova)
In a Cordova application, use the following JavaScript API method:

```javascript
WL.Analytics.send();
```

### JavaScript (Web)
In a Web application, use the following JavaScript API method (depending on the namespace you've selected):

```javascript
wlanalytics.send();
```

### iOS
In an iOS application, use the following *Objective-C* API method:

```objc
[[WLAnalytics sharedInstance] send];
```

or for *Swift* use the API method:

```swift
WLAnalytics.sharedInstance().send();
```

#### Android
In an Android application, use the following Java API method:

```java
WLAnalytics.send();
```

## Enabling/Disabling Client Event Types
The Analytics API gives the developer the freedom to enable and disable collecting Analytics for the event they want to visualize on their Analytics Console.

To build Cordova applications, the Analytics API does not have methods to enable or disable collection on `LIFECYCLE` or `NETWORK` events. In other words, Cordova applications come with `LIFECYCLE` and `NETWORK` events pre-enabled by default. If you want to disable these events, follow the [Client Lifecycle Events](#client-lifecycle-events
) and [Client Network Events](#client-lifecycle-events) on disabling events.

### Client Lifecycle Events
After the Analytics SDK is configured, app sessions start to be recorded on the user's device. A session in MobileFirst Operational Analytics is recorded when the app is moved from the foreground to the background, which creates a session on the analytics console.

As soon as the device is set up to record sessions and you send your data, you can see the analytics console populated with data, as shown below.

You can enable or disable the collecting of app sessions by using the following API:

#### JavaScript
**Web**  
Web applications do not support client lifecycle events.

**Cordova**  

* For the iOS platform:
	* Open the **[Cordova application root folder] → platforms → ios → Classes → AppDelegate.m** file
	* Follow the iOS guide below to enable or disable `LIFECYCLE` activities.
	* Build the Cordova project by running the command: `cordova build`

* For the Android platform:
	* Open the  **[Cordova appilcation root folder] → platforms → android → src → com → sample → [app-name] → MainActivity.java**
	* Look for the `onCreate` method and follow the Android guide below to enable or disable `LIFECYCLE` activities.
	* Build the Cordova project by running the command: `cordova build`

#### Android
To enable client lifecycle event logging:

```java
WLAnalytics.addDeviceEventListener(DeviceEvent.LIFECYCLE);
```

To disable client lifecycle event logging:

```java
WLAnalytics.removeDeviceEventListener(DeviceEvent.LIFECYCLE);
```

#### iOS
To enable client lifecycle event logging:

**Objective-C:**

```objc
[[WLAnalytics sharedInstance] addDeviceEventListener:LIFECYCLE];
```

**Swift:**

```swift
WLAnalytics.sharedInstance().addDeviceEventListener(LIFECYCLE);
```

To disable client lifecycle event logging:

**Objective-C:**

```objc
[[WLAnalytics sharedInstance] removeDeviceEventListener:LIFECYCLE];
```

**Swift:**

```swift
WLAnalytics.sharedInstance().removeDeviceEventListener(NETWORK);
```

### Client Network Activities
Collection on adapters and the network occur in two different locations: on the client and on the server:

* The client collects information such as roundtrip time and payload size when you start collecting on the `Network` device event.

* The server collects back-end information such as server processing time, adapter usage, used procedures.

Because the client and the server each collect their own information, charts do not display data until the client is configured to do so. To configure your client, you need to start collecting for the `NETWORK` device event.

#### JavaScript

**Web**  
Web applications do not support client network events.

**Cordova**  

* For the iOS platform:
	* Open the **[Cordova appilcation root folder] → platforms → ios → Classes → AppDelegate.m** file.
	* Follow the iOS guide below to enable or disable `NETWORK` activities.
	* Build the Cordova project by running the command: `cordova build`

* For the Android platform: navigate to the subactivity of the main activity to disable.
	* Open the  **[Cordova appilcation root folder] → platforms → ios → src → com → sample → [app-name] → MainActivity.java** file.
	* Look for the `onCreate` method and follow the Android guide below to enable or disable `NETWORK` activities.
	* Build the Cordova project by running the command: `cordova build`

#### iOS
To enable client network-event logging:

**Objective-C:**

```objc
[[WLAnalytics sharedInstance] addDeviceEventListener:NETWORK];
```

**Swift:**

```
WLAnalytics.sharedInstance().addDeviceEventListener(NETWORK);
```

To disable client network-event logging:

**Objective-C:**

```objc
[[WLAnalytics sharedInstance] removeDeviceEventListener:NETWORK];
```

**Swift:**

```swift
WLAnalytics.sharedInstance().removeDeviceEventListener(NETWORK);
```

#### Android
To enable client network-event logging:

```java
WLAnalytics.addDeviceEventListener(DeviceEvent.NETWORK);
```

To disable client network-event logging:

```java
WLAnalytics.removeDeviceEventListener(DeviceEvent.NETWORK);
```

## Custom Events
Use the following API methods to create custom events.

#### JavaScript (Cordova)

```javascript
WL.Analytics.log({"key" : 'value'});
WL.Analytics.send();
```

#### JavaScript (Web)
Depending on how you have referenced the Web SDK, you use either wlanalytics
```javascript


.log({"key" : 'value'});
WL.Analytics.send();
```


#### Android
After setting the first two configurations, you can start to log data as in this example:

```java
JSONObject json = new JSONObject();
try {
    json.put("key", "value");
} catch (JSONException e) {
    // TODO Auto-generated catch block
    e.printStackTrace();
}

WLAnalytics.log("Message", json);
WLAnalytics.send();
```

#### iOS
After importing WLAnalytics, you can now use the API to collect custom data, as follows:

**Objective-C:**

```objc
NSDictionary *inventory = @{
    @"property" : @"value",
};

[[WLAnalytics sharedInstance] log:@"Custom event" withMetadata:inventory];
[[WLAnalytics sharedInstance] send];
```

**Swift:**

```swift
let metadata: [NSObject: AnyObject] = ["foo": "bar"];  
WLAnalytics.sharedInstance().log("hello", withMetadata: metadata);
WLAnalytics.sharedInstance().send();
```

### Overview

MobileFirst Operational Analytics collects data about applications, adapters, devices, logs, and your own custom events to give a high-level view of the client interaction with the IBM MobileFirst Platform Server.

MobileFirst Operational Analytics is delivered as an EAR file which contains two WAR files: `analytics.war` and `analytics-service.war`. You can deploy the EAR file to the following supported application servers:

* Liberty
* WebSphere® Application Server
* Tomcat

**Note**: All of the Getting Started Operational Analytics tutorials will make the assumption that you are working in the development environment using a the embedded Liberty server. However, all the same concepts apply to Tomcat and WebSphere® Application Server.

In MobileFirst Studio, the two WAR files are installed and available by default in the embedded Liberty server.

<h2>What is Bluemix?</h2>
<p><strong>IBM Bluemix</strong> is an implementation of IBM's Open Cloud Architecture. It leverages <strong>Cloud Foundry</strong> to enable developers to rapidly build, deploy, and manage their cloud applications while tapping a growing ecosystem of available services and runtime frameworks.</p>
<p>Learn more about the Bluemix architecture and Bluemix concepts <a href="https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/overview/overview.html">on the Bluemix website</a>.</p>
<h2>IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation on IBM Containers</h2>
<p>In the context of IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation, it is possible to take an existing Foundation-based project and run it on top of Bluemix: no need to maintain IT infrastructure and other traditional hurdles any more. This feature opens up the ability to implement and use various Bluemix-provided services to complete and enhance the feature set of a given application.</p>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>In a nutshell: to run IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation on IBM Containers, several components must interact with one another: the first component is an <strong>image</strong> that contains a <strong>Linux distribution with a WebSphere Liberty installation</strong>, with a <strong>MobileFirst Server instance</strong> deployed to it. The image is then stored inside an <strong>IBM Container</strong>, and the IBM Container is managed by <strong>Bluemix</strong>.</p>
<h3>IBM Containers</h3>
<p>IBM Containers are objects that are used to run images in a hosted cloud environment. IBM Containers hold everything that an app needs to run.</p>
<p>The IBM Container infrastructure includes a private registry for your images, so that you can upload, store, and retrieve them. You can make those images available for Bluemix to manage them. A command line interface is then used to manage your containers on Bluemix - More on this in the following tutorials.</p>

<h2>What to follow next:</h2>
<p>The available tutorials provide two choices:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.ibm.com/mobilefirstplatform/documentation/getting-started-7-1/bluemix/evaluate-foundation-on-bluemix">Evaluate</a>: Experience the ease of creating a new IBM Container in Bluemix, launch a preconfigured IBM Container (with a MobileFirst Server instance) in it, and use an application that connects to the MobileFirst Server instance.</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.ibm.com/mobilefirstplatform/documentation/getting-started-7-1/bluemix/run-foundation-on-bluemix">Run</a>: Learn how to set up a development environment for working with IBM Containers, create and update an image with changes done in your local Foundation development environment, and how to run it on Bluemix.</li>
</ul>

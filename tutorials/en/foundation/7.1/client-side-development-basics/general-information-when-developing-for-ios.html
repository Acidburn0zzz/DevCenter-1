<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This tutorial presents general development information for the iOS environment in the following topics:</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="projStruct">Project structure</h2>
<p>A hybrid application with the iPhone/iPad environment which is developed by using IBM MobileFirst Platform comprises the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li>An Objective-C ("native") Main App Delegate is provided and hosts an instance of a UIWebView component.</li>
<li><code>www.bundle</code> files, which are written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and which run in the UIWebView instance.</li>
<li>A set of Objective-C and JavaScript libraries that provide access to various iOS features and capabilities.</li>
<li>All application components, including the web code that the developer provides, are packaged into a single universal iOS application.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>If you use a source control management system (such as Rational Team Concert, Git, Subversion and so on...), see the topic about integrating with source control system, in the user documentation</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="designIOS">Designing for iOS</h2>
<h3>Guidelines</h3>
<p>Starting with iOS7, the design language of the operating system has changed drastically.<br />
It is therefore highly encouraged and useful for developers to consult the Apple iOS Human Interface Guidelines on the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/">Designing for iOs</a> page.</p>
<p>When developing for iOS, it is also useful to consult the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/navigation/ ">iOS Developer Library</a> page.</p>
<h3>Resolutions</h3>
<p>iOS devices have various screen resolutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>iPhone 1/2/3/3GS – 320 x 480</li>
<li>iPhone 4/4S – 640 x 960</li>
<li>iPhone 5/5s – 640 x 1136</li>
<li>iPhone 6 - 1334 x 750</li>
<li>iPhone 6 plus - 1920 x 1080</li>
<li>iPad 1/2/mini – 768 x 1024</li>
<li>iPad 3/4/5 – 1,536 x 2,048</li>
</ul>
<p>When displaying graphical elements on wider screens, iOS automatically scales images and fonts to the appropriate ratio.<br />
For example, on a 640-pixel wide screen, a 100-pixel wide image is scaled by 640/320 (= 2) to 200 pixels in width, and the text that is displayed with an 18-pixel font is displayed with a 36-pixel font.</p>
<h3>Developer's actions</h3>
<p>As a developer, you are therefore responsible for the following adjustments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that images look good at all resolutions:
<ul>
<li>Provide images for the environment with the highest resolution requirements.</li>
<li>In the CSS, scale the image width to the lower resolution.<br />
            In the previous example, provide an image with a width of 200 pixels, and in the CSS, scale it to 100 pixels. iOS scales it back by a factor of 2 to be 200 pixels wide.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make sure that text is displayed appropriately at all resolutions.</li>
<li>Consider specifying font sizes in ems, rather than in pixels.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="envImages">Environment-specific images</h2>
<p>Image file sizes differ depending on your iDevice. For more information, see the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/userexperience/conceptual/mobilehig/IconMatrix.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006556-CH27-SW1">Apple iOS UI Development Guidelines for icon and image sizes</a> page.</p>
<h2 id="cordova">Accessing native capabilities by using Apache Cordova</h2>
<p>You can use the Apache Cordova framework in iOS applications to access the native elements of a device, such as contacts, geolocation services, media services, or the accelerometer.</p>
<p>For more information about Apache Cordova development, see the <a href="../../adding-native-functionality/apache-cordova-overview">Apache Cordova overview</a> tutorial.</p>
<h2 id="appOptim">Optimizing applications</h2>
<p>When developing a mobile application, you can use minification and concatenation to reduce the size and number of files that are used within the application. This feature is available for the following environments: Android, iOS, Windows 8, Windows Phone 8, BlackBerry 10, Mobile Web, and Desktop Browser.</p>
<blockquote><p>
For more information about minification and concatenation, see the topic about optimizing MobileFirst applications, in the user documentation.</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="deploy">Deployment</h2>
<p>iOS application deployment is done through the Apple App Store.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Before you build a production version of your application, make sure that the <code>worklightSettings</code> property is set to <code>false</code> in the <code>application-descriptor.xml</code> file.</p>
<ol>
<li>Follow the App Store approval process.</li>
<li>Manage your apps on the App Store.</li>
</ol>

MobileFirst Platform Foundation radically simplifies building, managing, and updating your mobile application with a pre-integrated, comprehensive set of mobile application services.

Developers can build their application using the front-end framework and tools of their choice, and easily add push, authentication, offline sync, and business logic to their apps with the MobileFirst software Development Kit (SDK) available across a wide range of supported mobile platforms. MobileFirst Platform Foundation enables you to control your application from client to server, and thus allows you to capture business data at the point of interaction. MobileFirst apps also enable you to employ a streamlined and repeatable process for incremental app updates and run your apps in flexible hybrid cloud patterns.
